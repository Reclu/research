The DGMPM is now illustrated on numerical examples considering materials based on the Hencky-based hyperelastic-plastic potential presented in \cite{Laurent2009} and isotropic hardening. 
The values of material parameters used are gathered in table \ref{tab:material}, the elastic behavior being given by Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$, and plastic flow governed by the yield stress in tension $\sigma^y$ and the hardening coefficient $H$.

\subsection{Plane wave problem}
\label{sec:plane-wave-problem}
Let's first look at the response of a infinite medium in directions $\vect{e}_2$ and $\vect{e}_3$ and length $l=1\:m$ in direction $\vect{e}_1$, to Riemann-type initial conditions on the velocity: $v_1=v_d>0$ for $X\in[0,l/2[$ and $v_1=-v_d$ for $X \in ]l/2,l]$.
The solid is initially in a free stress state and the initial velocity is set so that plastic flow occurs:
\begin{equation*}
  v_d=1.2\frac{Y_H}{\rho c_L}
\end{equation*}
where $Y_H=(\lambda+2\mu)\sigma^y/2\mu$ denotes the Hugoniot elastic limit, $c_L=\sqrt{(\lambda+2\mu)/\rho}$ is the elastic pressure wave speed, and $(\lambda,\mu)$ are Lam\'e's constants. Both ends of the medium are traction free.
%so that rightward and leftward compressive elastic waves reflect as unloading waves that interact with the incident plastic ones \cite{Thomas_EVP}.
The initial setting is assumed to give rise to a plane wave, namely:
\begin{align*}
  & \tens{F}= F \vect{e}_1 \otimes\vect{e}_1 + \vect{e}_2 \otimes\vect{e}_2 + \vect{e}_3 \otimes\vect{e}_3\\
  & \tens{\Pi}=\Pi_L \vect{e}_1 \otimes \vect{e}_1 + \Pi_T \(\vect{e}_2 \otimes \vect{e}_2+\vect{e}_3 \otimes \vect{e}_3\) 
\end{align*}
In the linearized geometrical limit $\norm{\tens{F}} \ll 1$ and considering linear isotropic hardening, the computed hyperelastic-plastic solution should tend to the elastoplastic one derived in \cite{Thomas_EP}.
The latter consists of two elastic compression waves propagating left and right-ward, each followed by one plastic discontinuity.
The incident elastic disturbances then reflect as unloading waves on both free boundaries of the domain, the interaction of which at the center of the medium leads to tensile plastic reloading.
In figure \ref{fig:hep_planeWave}, the numerical solutions provided by the DGMPM, the MPM and the FEM are compared to the exact solution of the small strain problem in terms of longitudinal components of the PK1 stress and the Green-Lagrange plastic strain $\tens{E}^p=\frac{1}{2}\({\tens{F}^p}^T\tens{F}^p - \tens{I}\)$.
Linear elements and a lumped mass matrix are used within FEM with no artificial viscosity added, and mesh is built so that Gauss' points are consistent with the particles.
Moreover, while the MPM is only based on a one-particle-per-cell (1ppc) space discretization, DGMPM computations have also been done with two-particles-per-cell (2ppc).
In the latter case, the material points sharing an element are placed symmetrically with respect to elements centers and are regularly spaced in the domain.
For the comparison, all numerical methods are based on a total Lagrangian formulation and make use of the same variational constitutive update.

  \label{fig:hep_planeWave}
\end{figure}
First, the incident elastic compression waves are well described by the FEM and the DGMPM using 1ppc due to the Courant number that can be set to unity, which is not the case of the MPM and the DGMPM based on 4ppc as seen in figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave1}.
The resolution of the plastic flow leads however to less sharp solutions for all numerical schemes, the finite element solution being the steepest one.
Moreover, the figure shows that the decrease in CFL number involved by the use of 4ppc yields a much smoother stress profile with the DGMPM, though the correct level is reached on the plastic plateau.
This has a impact on the plastic strain, which lags behind the other solutions.
On the other hand, MPM and FEM plastic strains exhibit significant overshoots.

Similar observations can be made in figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave2} in which elastic unloading occurs.
FEM and DGMPM(1ppc) stresses are rather close to the small strains exact solution, while the two other schemes provide smoother profile near discontinuities.

Next, the plastic tensile reloading that results from the interaction of the unloading waves in the central region can be seen in figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave3}.
Once again, FEM and DGMPM(1ppc) lead to quite similar results in terms of stress and plastic strain which show good agreement with the exact solution although the discontinuities are not exactly captured.
In contrast, the stress profiles provided by the MPM and the DGMPM(4ppc) remain smooth in such a way that the waves cannot be distinguished.
As a result, the corresponding plastic strains significantly differ from the exact solution.
Notice that both approaches underestimate the plastic strain at the middle of the domain.
This is due to the overshoot in the MPM solution on the incident plastic plateau, and to the delay exhibited by the DGMPM(4ppc) plastic strain.

$\newline$
The initial velocity is now raised to $v_d=4Y_H/\rho c_L$ so that the small strain assumption no longer holds.
Again, the numerical results in terms of longitudinal stress and plastic strain are depicted in figure \ref{fig:hep_planeWave_high}.
It can first be seen in figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave_high_1} that the behavior of the numerical approaches employed are similar to the previous loading case, though oscillations appear in the finite element stress on the plastic plateau.
Thus, the overestimation of plastic strain within the FEM get closer to that of the MPM.
These spurious oscillations remain in the FEM solution after the reflection of waves at the free ends (see figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave2}).

  \label{fig:hep_planeWave_high}
\end{figure}
In addition, the DGMPM behaves well whereas the 4ppc space discretization yields once again smoother results than the other approaches.
Nevertheless, the delay that was observed in the DGMPM(4ppc) plastic strain is now less significant.

At last, figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave_high_3} shows important differences involved by the value of the initial velocity.
Indeed, it can be seen that the plastic strain starts decreasing as it would be the case for a tensile plastic reloading, while the stress profile is still compressive.
This response is most likely due to the integration of the plastic flow in the finite deformation framework which couples the components of the plastic part of the deformation gradient.
However, the FEM and DGMPM(1ppc) stress solutions in figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave_high_3} are rather close to each other, though slightly shifted.
At the middle of the solid, both stress solutions exhibit a peak that is not in the MPM solution, the latter showing nonetheless good agreement.
The DGMPM(4ppc), one the other hand, seems to overestimate the stress in the central region.
This can be explained by the unloading waves in figure \ref{subfig:he_planeWave_high_2} for which the DGMPM(4ppc) stress is ahead of the other methods.
Hence, a similar behavior is observed for the plastic strain.

\subsection{Plane strain problem}
\label{sec:plane-strain-problem}
%% Comparison at t=0.00102126
We now consider an infinite domain in the direction $\vect{e}_3$ with square section of dimension $l=3m$, made of the same material as above.
The left and bottom boundaries of the solid are normally fixed and a negative initial velocity is prescribed so that the problem can be seen as a plane strain version of the Taylor bar impact (see figure \ref{subfig:2D_domain}).


The MPM and the DGMPM are compared to a $Q1$-finite element (bilinear approximation) solution coupled with a central difference explicit time integrator.
The domain is discretized such that material points are equivalent to finite element nodes: $l\times l \equiv 28 \times 28$ particles and nodes.
Moreover, two arbitrary grids are used for the particle-based methods so that either one or four material points lie in every cell according to the situations depicted in figure \ref{fig:2D_meshes}.

In figure \ref{fig:PS_taylor}, comparisons of the isovalues of longitudinal PK1 stress $\Pi_{11}$ and cumulated plastic strain $p$ are depicted for two time steps that correspond to the incident and reflected pressure waves.
The fields are plotted on the current configuration so as to show the deformed shape resulting from each simulation.
