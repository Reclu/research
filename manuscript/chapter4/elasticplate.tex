We now consider an elastic solid with square section of dimension $l=3m$ in the ($\vect{e}_1,\vect{e}_2$) plane, and infinite in the direction $\vect{e}_3$ so that the plane strain assumption (\textit{i.e. $\eps_{33}=\eps_{13}=\eps_{23}=0$}) holds. The values of elastic parameters considered are still those of table \ref{tab:material}. The solid suddenly undergoes a tensile stress on a part of its left boundary (see figure \ref{fig:2D_planeStrain}\subref{subfig:2D_problem}) so that shear and pressure waves travel in the mediumtoward the horizontally fixed right end, reflect and then propagate leftward.

\end{figure}
The exact solution of this problem being unknown, DGMPM solutions using the CTU method are compared to the MPM solution and to $Q1$ finite element (bilinear approximation) solutions obtained with the code Cast3M Drexus \cite{Castem}.

The solid is discretized such that material points are equivalent to finite element nodes, that is: $l\times l \equiv 28 \times 28$ particles and nodes. Moreover, two arbitrary grids are used for the DGMPM so that either one of four material points lie in every cells as depicted in figure \ref{fig:2D_planeStrain}\subref{subfig:2d_meshes} for a coarse example.
Figure \ref{fig:2delast_comparison} shows the isovalues of longitudinal stress $\sigma_{11}$ in the two-dimensional medium resulting from every numerical methods stated above at two different times with the traction force set to $\sigma^d=200\: Mpa$. The first and second lines of plots respectively corresponds to the stress profile before and after reflection of the pressure wave on the right boundary of the domain.
Unlike FEM and MPM, the DGMPM does not exhibit oscillations regardless of the number of particles in grid cells. Nevertheless, the decrease in the CFL number involved by the 4ppc discretization yield a less accurate resolution of the jump discontinuity carried by the longitudinal pressure wave than for 1ppc.

On the other hand, the propagation of waves in both directions $\vect{e}_1$ and $\vect{e}_2$ provides a cylindrical profile to the longitudinal stress that is almost indentically described by FEM and DGMPM using 1ppc, even after reflection of the fixed boundary (second row in figure \ref{fig:2delast_comparison}). The smoothness of the DGMPM solutions using 4ppc and the oscillations in MPM results prevent distinguishing this structure.
