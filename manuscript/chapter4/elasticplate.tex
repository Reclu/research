We now consider an elastic solid with square section of dimension $l=3m$ in the ($\vect{e}_1,\vect{e}_2$) plane, infinite in direction $\vect{e}_3$ so that the plane strain assumption holds (\textit{i.e. $\eps_{33}=\eps_{13}=\eps_{23}=0$}). The solid suddenly undergoes a tensile stress on a part of its left boundary (see figure \ref{fig:2D_planeStrain}\subref{subfig:2D_problem}) leading to shear and pressure waves travelling in the medium toward the horizontally fixed right end, where the reflect and then propagate leftward.

The MPM and the DGMPM using CTU method are compared to a $Q1$ finite element (bilinear approximation) solution obtained with the code Cast3M Drexus \cite{Castem}.

The domain is discretized such that material points are equivalent to finite element nodes, that is: $l\times l \equiv 28 \times 28$ particles and nodes. Moreover, two arbitrary grids are used for the DGMPM so that either one or four material points lie in every cells as depicted in figure \ref{fig:2D_planeStrain}\subref{subfig:2d_meshes} for a coarse example.

Figure \ref{fig:2delast_comparison} shows the isovalues of longitudinal stress $\sigma_{11}$ in the two-dimensional medium resulting from every numerical methods stated above at two different times with the traction force set to $\sigma^d=200\: Mpa$. The first and second lines of plots respectively corresponds to the stress profile before and after reflection of the pressure wave on the right boundary of the domain.
Unlike FEM and MPM, DGMPM solutions do not exhibit oscillations. Nevertheless, the decrease in the CFL number involved by the 4ppc discretization yields a less accurate resolution of the jump discontinuity carried by the longitudinal pressure wave than for 1ppc.

On the other hand, the propagation of waves in both directions $\vect{e}_1$ and $\vect{e}_2$ provides a cylindrical profile of the longitudinal stress that is almost indentically described by FEM and DGMPM with 1ppc, even after reflection of the fixed boundary. The smoothness of the DGMPM solutions using 4ppc and the oscillations in MPM results prevent distinguishing this structure.
