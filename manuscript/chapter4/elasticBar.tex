To begin with, let's focus on the problem that illustrated some shortcomings of the MPM in section \ref{sec:MPM} and motivated the development of the DGMPM.
We thus consider a bar of length $l=6\:m$ in direction $\vect{e}_1$ in which the Cauchy stress and infinitesimal strain tensors are of the form:
\begin{align*}
  & \tens{\sigma} = \sigma \: \vect{e}_1\otimes \vect{e}_1 \\
  & \tens{\eps} = \eps \: \vect{e}_1\otimes \vect{e}_1
\end{align*}
The stress is initially zero everywhere and Riemann-type initial conditions on the axial velocity $v=\vect{v}\cdot\vect{e}_1$ are prescribed: $v=v_0>0$ for $x_1\in [0,L/2[$ and $v=-v_0$ for $x_1\in \:]L/2,L]$. In addition, both ends of the domain are traction free.
%The bar is assumed elastic with density $\rho=7800 \: kg.m^{-3}$, Poisson ration $\nu=0.3$ and Young's modulus $E=2\times 10^{11}\:Pa$.
The exact solution of this problem \cite[Ch.1]{Wang}, recalled in section \ref{subsec:charac_Linear_problems}, consists of two elastic discontinuities propagating leftward and rightward in the bar at constant speeds $c=\pm\sqrt{E/\rho}$. 
The discretization of the domain lies on a regular background grid made of $50$ regular cells containing material points distributed so that two situations are distinguished: each cell contains one particle that coincides with the element centroid for the $1ppc$ discretization; each cell contains two particles symmetrically placed with respect to element centers and regularly spaced in the grid for the $2ppc$ discretization.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item[(1)] $1ppc$ discretization: each cell contains one particle that coincides with the element centroid
% \item[(2)] $2ppc$ discretization: each cell contains two particles symmetrically placed with respect to element centers. The particles are moreover regularly spaced in the grid.
% \end{itemize}
% Those two configurations using either one or two Particles Per Cell are respectively referred to as $1ppc$ and $2ppc$ hereinafter.

The problem is solved on the one hand with the MPM-USL in which the nodal velocity is based on either FLIP of PIC mappings ($CFL=0.5$), and with the DGMPM coupled with both Euler and RK2 time integration on the other hand.
% The Courant number is set at $CFL=1$ for the DGMPM-Euler with 1ppc and DGMPM-RK2 with 2ppc, while it must be reduced to $CFL=0.5$ if 2ppc are used within or the DGMPM-Euler 
%  ($CFL$ satisfying the stability condition \eqref{eq:stability} in section \ref{sec:DGMPM_analysis}).

\end{figure}
According to the stability condition \eqref{eq:stability}, the Courant number is set to unity within the DGMPM-Euler with 1ppc and DGMPM-RK2 with 2ppc, while the use of 2ppc within the DGMPM-Euler leads to $CFL=0.5$.   
Figure \ref{fig:elastic_stress} shows the numerical solutions at two different times in terms of stress and velocity, compared to exact ones. 
First, since the Courant number can be set to one for the DGMPM-Euler with 1ppc, the method is able to capture the discontinuities and yields solutions fitting perfectly the analytical ones. The same property holds for the DGMPM-RK2 with 2ppc while for the same discretization the DGMPM-Euler is restricted by a lower CFL number that prevents the accurate resolution of waves.
As identified in section \ref{sec:MPM}, the use of PIC mapping within the DGMPM leads to solutions that do not exhibit oscillations.

In addition, this projection of updated fields from nodes to particles allows to eliminate the locking of velocity in the central region that can be seen in USL-FLIP solutions.

Moreover, \textbf{the introduction of DG approximation within the USL-PIC leads to a reduction of numerical diffusion}, though less significant than that permitted by using FLIP mapping as originally proposed in the MPM.
This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:energy_elastic_RP} in which the evolution of total energies resulting from every numerical schemes is depicted.
The situations for which the CFL number is set to unity for DGMPM formulations obviously yields an exact conservation of the total energy during the computation while other results suffer from diffusion.

Since, the number of material points per cell has little influence on USL results, the MPM is from now only used with the 1ppc discretization.
Furthermore, PIC mapping has been used here within the MPM for comparison purposes and is no longer considered in the remainder simulations.
