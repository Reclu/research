\chapter{Numerical Results}
\section*{Introduction}
The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method developed in the previous chapter is now illustrated and compared to other numerical schemes and exact solutions. 
First, problems falling in the small strains framework are considered in section \ref{sec:hpp_simulations}. More specifically, DGMPM solutions of the Riemann problem in an elastic bar is compared MPM to ones in section \ref{subsec:hpp_bar}. The methods are then applied to the solution of problems involving multi-dimensional stress and one-dimensional strain states (plane wave problem) in section \ref{subsec:hpp_planewave}, and to the solution of plane strain problems in sections \ref{subsec:el_planestrain} and \ref{subsec:ep_planestrain}. Comparisons with MPM, FVM, FEM and exact (when existing) solutions are shown for elastic, elastic-viscoplastic and elastoplastic solids.
%one and two-dimensional problems that fall within the infinitesimal theory will be considered for elastic, elastic-viscoplastic and elastoplastic materials in sections \ref{sec:hpp_bar} and \ref{sec:hpp_planewave}.

Second, attention is paid to problems involving waves travelling in finite deforming solids in section \ref{sec:he_simulations}, for which history-dependent constitutive models are not considered.
%For that purpose, the propagation of plane waves in a hyperelastic Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff medium and a plane strain state problem in a Neo-Hookean solid are considered (sections \ref{subsec:he_planewave} and \ref{subsec:he_plate}). The DGMPM simulations performed on the former cases are compared to the MPM solution and the exact one, while comparisons with MPM and FEM are proposed on the latter.
For that purpose, DGMPM simulations performed on plane wave problems in a hyperelastic Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff medium are compared to MPM and exact solutions in section \ref{subsec:he_planewave}. At last, a comparison between DGMPM, FEM and MPM solutions of a plane strain state problem in a Neo-Hookean solid is proposed in section \ref{subsec:he_plate}.

Although several constitutive models are assumed in this chapter, elastic, viscous and plastic properties considered ar the same for every materials. Thus, table \ref{tab:material} summarizes the values of Young's modulus $E$, Poisson ratio $\nu$ and reference mass density $\rho_0$.
In addition, linear isotropic and kinematic hardenings of modulus $H$ and tensile yield stress $\sigma^y$ are assumed for plastic evolutions, along with the viscosity $\eta$ and sensitivity $n$ for viscous ones.

At last, no body forces are considered here.
