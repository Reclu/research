\section*{Introduction}
The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method developed in the previous chapter is now illustrated and compared to other numerical schemes (MPM, FVM, FEM) or analytical solutions. 
Firstly, one and two-dimensional problems that fall within the infinitesimal theory will be considered for elastic, elastic-viscoplastic and elastoplastic materials in sections \ref{sec:1dhpp_simulations} and \ref{sec:2dhpp_simulations}. The simulations performed in that context show significant improvements enabled by the introduction of DG approximation in the MPM. Second, numerical solutions of problems involving waves travelling in finite deforming solids, for which the dependence on history of constitutive models is neglected, are analyzed in sections \ref{sec:1dhe_simulations} and \ref{sec:2dhe_simulations}.

% Run again the test case with an updated CFL if many ppcs. Also look at the mass matrix that is probably zero for first node, the grid must be moved or something like that.
