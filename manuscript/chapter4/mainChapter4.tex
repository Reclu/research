First, problems falling in the small deformation framework are considered in section \ref{sec:hpp_simulations}. More specifically, DGMPM and MPM solutions of the Riemann problem in an elastic bar are compared in section \ref{subsec:hpp_bar}. The methods are then applied to the solution of problems involving multi-dimensional stress and one-dimensional strain states (plane wave problem) in section \ref{subsec:hpp_planewave}, and a plane strain state in sections \ref{subsec:el_planestrain} and \ref{subsec:ep_planestrain}. Comparisons with MPM, FVM, FEM and exact (when existing) solutions are shown for elastic, elastic-viscoplastic and elastoplastic solids.
Those simulations highlight the ability of the method to track sharp solutions and the possibility of using dedicated numerical tools to accurately deal with history-dependent constitutive models, which of particular interest for the applications aimed by the DGMPM. 

In section \ref{sec:he_simulations}, attention is paid to problems involving waves travelling in finite deforming solids, for which history-dependent constitutive models are not considered.
For that purpose, DGMPM simulations performed on plane wave problems in a hyperelastic Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff medium are compared to MPM and exact solutions in section \ref{subsec:he_planewave}. Then, a comparison between DGMPM, FEM and MPM solutions of a plane strain state problem in a Neo-Hookean solid is proposed in section \ref{subsec:he_plate}.

Although several constitutive models are assumed in this chapter, elastic, viscous and plastic properties considered are the same for every materials. Table \ref{tab:material} summarizes the values of Young's modulus $E$, Poisson ratio $\nu$ and reference mass density $\rho_0$.
In addition, linear isotropic or kinematic hardenings of modulus $H$ and tensile yield stress $\sigma^y$ are assumed for plastic evolutions, along with the viscosity $\eta$ and sensitivity $n$ for viscous ones.

\section{Conclusion}
The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point method has been applied here to hyperbolic problems of solid mechanics.
It has first been shown on a Riemann problem in a linear elastic bar under small strains in section \ref{subsec:hpp_bar}, that the method is able to capture the exact solution that consist of two elastic discontinuities propagating in the medium.
Indeed, the stability properties of the one-dimensional schemes derived in section \ref{subsec:scheme_equations} enables, for particular space discretizations, the use of a CFL number set to unity.
In such situations, the DGMPM exactly conserves the total energy despite the use of PIC mapping, which is known to introduce dissipation within the MPM.
Nevertheless, once the optimal stability condition is lost, that is $CFL <1$, the method is slightly more diffusive than the MPM.
Next, the solution of problems in history-dependent solids emphasized (sections \ref{subsec:hpp_planewave}), through the use of splitting methods or a one-dimensional elastic-plastic Riemann solver, the versatility of the method.
In addition, the results of section \ref{subsec:he_planewave} highlights that the total Lagrangian formulation of the DGMPM allows to avoid the eventual grid crossing occuring in updated Lagrangian MPM for problems involving waves in finite deforming solids.
As a consequence, the numerical scheme also provides solutions that are close to exact ones for non-linear problems, although an updated Lagrangian formulation of the method that would lead to numerical issues still has to be derived. 
% extend it to updated Lagrangian formulations ?

At last, the two-dimensional simulations performed in sections \ref{subsec:el_planestrain}, \ref{subsec:ep_planestrain} and \ref{subsec:he_plate} show that DGMPM results are in good agreements with FEM while eliminating spurious oscillations.
Moreover, numerical tools used for one-dimensional problems can be generalized for two-dimensional ones. This is the case of splitting procedures that should enable the DGMPM to accurately follow waves travelling in elastic-viscoplastic solids in 2D. Nevertheless, approximate elastic-plastic Riemann solvers, as that used in section \ref{subsec:hpp_planewave}, do not exist for general two-dimensional problems. Such solvers for the computation of intercell fluxes, which would improve the computation of plastic flows and hence a better assessement of residual stresses and strains, are discussed in the next chapter.
