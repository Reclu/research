%% Introduction:
The purpose of that work was the development of a numerical method allowing the accurate solution of hyperbolic problems in solid mechanics.
This class of mathematical problems governs the propagation of waves in finite deforming media.
Given the ability in dealing with large deformation enabled by meshless methods and the possiblity of describing discontinuous solutions provided by the DG approximation, it has been proposed to merge those to approaches.
