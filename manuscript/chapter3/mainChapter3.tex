%% MPM "survey"
MPM = collocation method ?
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{PIC}: Analogy with FVM since mean values of fields are defined in cells
\item \cite{FLIP}: mapping in momentum when particles cross a cell (see \cite{PIC_Nishiguchi}) ; finite volume for each particle (not a dirac) ; Make use of grid velocity and not material point velocity to update particles kinematic by direct interpolation to model \textit{collisional fluids} $\vect{v}_p=S_{ip}\vect{v}_i$
\item \cite{Mass_Flip}: "coarse-grained" (see \cite{Brackbill_PIC}), better to have a \textit{sub-grid-scale motion} and no additional diffusion ; mapp changes of fields instead of fields 
\end{itemize}
