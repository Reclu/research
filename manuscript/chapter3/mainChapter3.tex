\chapter{The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method}

\section*{Introduction}
It has been highlighted in the previous chapter that even though exact solution of hyperbolic systems have been derived, it is not possible in general. It is indeed well known that in addition to the mathematical complexity of PDEs, physics often involves multidimensional problems in solid domains with complex geometries that cannot be solved analytically. Numerical strategies may then be employed in order to compute an approximate solution.

A wide variety of numerical methods has been developed since the early 50's and consists mainly in mesh-based schemes, that is methods in which a complex domain is subdivided into elements of simple
shapes in which the approximate solution is computed (\textit{finite element \cite{Belytschko}, finite volume \cite{Leveque} etc.}). Problems involving very large deformations may lead to numerical difficulties when such approaches are used with a material description (Lagrangian formulation) due to severe mesh distortions. The Material Point Method (MPM) \cite{Sulsky94} mixes the advantages of Lagrangian and Eulerian methods in order to circumvent this drawback. Nevertheless the MPM suffers from other limitations that make it unable to accurately capture the waves travelling in solids, that is numerical diffusion and oscillations. These drawbacks have been the object of researches that yield significant improvements without allowing the capture of discontinuities. This is the purpose of what follows.

In this chapter, a brief historical review of the developments about the MPM formulation is made and the original formulation is recalled in section \ref{sec:MPM}. Next, after highlighting some limitations of the method, an extension of the MPM to the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approximation is proposed in section \ref{sec:DGMPM}. At last, the numerical analysis of the DGMPM is performed in section \ref{sec:DGMPM_analysis} in terms of convergence and stability with which we see that the optimal Courant number may be reach in specific cases.
