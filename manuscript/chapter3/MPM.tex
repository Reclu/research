% \subsection{Historical review}

The early developments that led to the original MPM started with the \textbf{Particle-In-Cell} method (PIC) formulated for fluid dynamics problems \cite{PIC}. The novelty brought by PIC was the representation of a fluid by a collection of moving particles inside a background control volume subdivided into cells. Every single particle is given a constant mass and a position which is updated based on the velocity field resulting from the solution of linear momentum balance equation on the fixed background mesh. On the other hand, velocity, energy and pressure are stored at cells during the whole computation ($C^0$ approximation). A \textit{convective phase}, which consists in a weighting procedure, must be followed when a particle leaves a cell and enters a new one \cite{PIC}. Thus, the PIC enables the merging of Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques since the moving particles with ascribed masses enables the simulation of problems involving several highly deformed fluids without mesh distortion.

In spite of the good results provided by the PIC, the numerical diffusion it suffers from has been addressed by two different ways. First the method has been extended to a \textit{fully Lagrangian} approach \cite{McCrory_FLIP} by storing not only mass and position but all the fields at particles. Next, a new projection procedure has been proposed between the grid and the particles in order to reach second-order accuracy in space of the convective phase \cite{PIC_Nishiguchi}. The merging of those two improvements yielded the so-called \textbf{FLuid Implicit Particle} method (FLIP) \cite{FLIP}. In this new PIC formulation, every quantities are stored at particles so that the grid is only used for solving balance equations and hence provides an adaptive feature to the numerical scheme. The projection of fields from Lagrangian particles to the Eulerian mesh is made as in PIC while the backward mapping models the \textit{collisional} behavior of the fluid and leads to a double definition of the velocity. Indeed, the linear momentum resulting from the solution of balance equations on the grid is used to update the position of particles, whereas the change of linear momentum is used to update their velocity \cite{Mass_Flip}. This procedure yields a time derivative of particles displacement that is different from their velocity which, although it introduces oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities, provides better results in terms of numerical diffusion \cite{Mass_Flip}.

Even though particles carry the whole history of the problem, FLIP has been essentialy used until the 90's to model history-independent constitutive models wich were dealt with on the grid. The first application of the method to history-dependent materials was made in the context of solid mechanics and yields the \textbf{Material Point Method} (MPM) \cite{Sulsky94}. %Since this formulation was based on a weak formulation for which \textit{material points} plays the role of integration points, the MPM may be seen as an extension of the Finite Element Method with moving Gauss points. Indeed, each material point is ascribed a volume by means of a delta Dirac \textit{characteristic function} which allows to approximate the volume integrals of the weak form by discrete sums over the Lagrangian particles.

\subsection{Derivation of the MPM}
Consider a solid domain with volume $\Omega_t$ bounded by the surface $\partial \Omega_t$, subject to traction forces and prescribed velocity on its boundaries within the time interval $\tau$:
\begin{align}
  & \tens{\sigma}\cdot\vect{n}=\vect{T}^d \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega_t^\sigma\\
  & \vect{v} = \vect{v}^d \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega_t^v
\end{align}
where $\vect{n}$ is the outward normal vector to $\partial \Omega_t$ and the set of boundaries satisfies $\partial \Omega_t =\partial \Omega^\sigma_t \cap \partial \Omega^v_t$.
%We seek an approximate solution of the eulerian balance equation of linear momentum \eqref{eq:HPP_linear_momentum} in a finite-dimensional function space using Galerkin approach. 

\subsubsection*{Weak formulation of the continuum problem}
The weak form of the eulerian balance equation of linear momentum \eqref{eq:HPP_linear_momentum} is written based on the Galerkin approach and the following function spaces:
\begin{equation}
\Vscr^1 = \{ \vect{u} \in H^1(\Omega_t) \}  \quad ; \quad \Vscr^1_{h} = \{\vect{u} \in \Vscr^1 | \vect{u}=\vect{v}^d \text{ on } \partial \Omega_t^v \}  \quad ; \quad \Vscr^1_{h,0} = \{\vect{u} \in \Vscr_h^1 | \vect{u}=\vect{0} \text{ on } \partial \Omega_t^v \} 
\end{equation}
where $H^1(\Omega_t)$ denotes the \textit{Sobolev} space in $\Omega_t$ \cite{DiPietro}. Thus, multiplication of equation \eqref{eq:HPP_linear_momentum} by a test function $\vect{w} \in \Vscr^1_{h,0}$ and integration over $\Omega_t$ yields, after integration by parts, the following weak form:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:linear_momentum_weak_form}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\text{Find $\vect{v}\in \Vscr_h^1$ such that} \\
    &\int_{\Omega_t}  \rho  \vect{\dot{v}} \cdot \vect{w}\: dv + \int_{\Omega_t}\tens{\sigma}: 
    \nablat \vect{w} \:dv - \int_{\partial \Omega^\sigma_t} \vect{T}^d\cdot\vect{w}\: ds= \int_{\Omega_t} \rho \vect{b}\cdot \vect{w} \: dv  \qquad \forall \: \vect{w} \in \Vscr_{h,0}^1
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The MPM discretization}
The continuum body is discretized into a set of $N_p$ material points in an arbitrary Cartesian grid. The grid is here supposed to be made of $N_n$ nodes and $E$ non-overlapping cells or elements, which set of faces separating cells that contain particles and having empty neighboring elements defines the boundary of the mesh (see figure \ref{fig:domain} for a two-dimensional case).
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  {\input{chapter3/pgfFigures/continuum}}
  {\input{chapter3/pgfFigures/mpm_discretization}}
  \caption{Representation of a continuum body by a set of material points in $\Rbb^2$.}
  \label{fig:domain}	
\end{figure}
Analogously to the Finite Element Method (FEM) \cite{Belytschko}, the velocity is approximated on the MPM background mesh by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:approximation_basis}
  \vect{v}(\vect{x},t)=S_i(\vect{x})\vect{v}^{i}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\vect{v}^{i}$ is the velocity of the $i$th grid node, and $S_i(\vect{x})$ the (linear) shape function attached to it. One feature of the MPM is that the mass density is approximated on the grid based on the mass carried by each material point:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:density_approx}
  \rho\(\vect{x},t\)=\sum_{p=1}^{N_p} m_p \delta(\vect{x}_p-\vect{x})
\end{equation}
where the delta Dirac distribution $\delta$ is often referred to as the \textit{characteristic function} of material points, and $\vect{x}_p$ is the position of the $p$th particle. In what follows, the dependence on time will be omitted for simplicity and $p$ and $i$ or $j$ stand respectively for material points and nodes.

By introducing a specific Cauchy tensor $\rho \tens{\bar{\sigma}}=\tens{\sigma}$ and the approximation of mass density \eqref{eq:density_approx} in the weak form \eqref{eq:linear_momentum_weak_form}, the property of the delta Dirac distribution yields:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\text{Find $\vect{v}\in \Vscr_h^1$ such that} \\
    & \sum_{p=1}^{N_p} m_p  \[\vect{\dot{v}}(\vect{x}_p) \cdot \vect{w}(\vect{x}_p) + \tens{\bar{\sigma}}(\vect{x}_p):\nablat \vect{w}(\vect{x}_p) \]  = \sum_{p=1}^{N_p}m_p \vect{b}(\vect{x}_p)\cdot \vect{w}(\vect{x}_p) + \int_{\partial \Omega^\sigma_t} \vect{T}^d\cdot\vect{w}\: ds  \qquad \forall \: \vect{w} \in \Vscr_{h,0}^1
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Then, with the approximation \eqref{eq:approximation_basis}, the weak form reads:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mpm_discrete_weak}
    \begin{aligned}
      &\text{Find $\vect{v} \in \Vscr_h^1$ such that} \\
      & \vect{w}^j \sum_{p=1}^{N_p} m_p  \[ S_{jp} S_{ip} \vect{\dot{v}}^i + \nablav S_{jp} \cdot \tens{\bar{\sigma}}^p \]  =  \vect{w}^j\( \sum_{p=1}^{N_p}m_p S_{jp}\vect{b}^i  + \int_{\partial \Omega^\sigma_t} S_j(\vect{x})\vect{T}^d\: ds\)  \qquad \forall \: \vect{w} \in \Vscr_{h,0}^1
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
in which $S_{ip}=S_i(\vect{x}_p)$ and $\tens{\bar{\sigma}}^p=\tens{\bar{\sigma}}(\vect{x}_p)$. Next, the arbitrariness of the test function $\vect{w}$ yields the semi-discrete equation in matrix form:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mpm_semi-discrete}
  m_{ji} \vect{\dot{v}}^i = \vect{f}_{int}^j + \vect{f}_{ext}^j 
\end{equation}
where the definition of the mass matrix $m_{ij}$ and the internal and external force vectors $\vect{f}_{int}^j $ and $\vect{f}_{ext}^j$ are:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    & m_{ij}= \sum_{p=1}^{N_p} m_p  S_{jp} S_{ip} \label{eq:mass_matrix}\\
    & \vect{f}_{int}^j = - \sum_{p=1}^{N_p} m_p \nablav S_{jp} \cdot \tens{\bar{\sigma}}^p \label{eq:int_forces}\\
    & \vect{f}_{ext}^j =\sum_{p=1}^{N_p}m_p S_{jp}\vect{b}^i  + \int_{\partial \Omega^\sigma_t} S_j(\vect{x})\vect{T}^d\: ds \label{eq:ext_forces}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
The system \eqref{eq:mpm_semi-discrete} can be solved for the nodal accelerations $\vect{\dot{v}}^i$, and advanced in time by using an explicit time discretization so that the nodal velocities can be updated. Hence, the time interval $\tau$ is discretized in $N_T$ sub-intervals of size $\Delta t^n$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^{N_T} \Delta t^n = T$ and time integration is performed with an explicit forward Euler algorithm leading to discrete equations:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mpm_discrete}
  \frac{\vect{v}^{i,n+1}-\vect{v}^{i,n}}{\Delta t^n} = \vect{\dot{v}}^i
\end{equation}
where the superscripts $\bullet^{k,l}$ denote the time step $l$ at which the $k$th nodal field is evaluated. 

Note that in the weak form, the particles play the role of integration points so that the mass matrix depends on the positions of material points in the grid and must be computed at each time step. Hence, the MPM can be seen as an extension of the Finite Element Method with moving Gauss points. However, a consequence of this quadrature rule is that the consistent mass matrix $m_{ji}$ may be singular when only one material point lies in an element due to the reduced integration. The use of a linear combination of the diagonally lumped mass matrix $m^L_i=\sum_p S_{ip}m_p$ (positive-definite), and the constitent mass matrix (positive semi-definite) is then recommended \cite{Love}. Nevertheless, since no parameter value is prescribed for this combination, the lumped mass matrix is widely used in MPM simulations, though it introduces some dissipation of kinetic energy \cite{Mass_Flip}.  

Recall that the background grid inherited from FLIP is arbitrary and that the fields must be projected from particles to the nodes to solve the linear system \eqref{eq:mpm_discrete} and back so that the material points advect the solution. The first mapping step, required to build the discrete form,
aims at satify the conservation of linear momentum from particles to the grid:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:particles2nodes}
  m^{L,n}_i \vect{v}^{i,n} = \sum_{p=1}^{N_p} S_{ip}m_p \vect{v}^{p,n}
\end{equation}
to be solved for each $\vect{v}^i$. Once the nodal accelerations are calculeted for system \eqref{eq:mpm_semi-discrete}, the velocity of each material points is \textbf{updated} as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mp_velocity_update}
  \vect{v}^{p,n+1}= \vect{v}^{p,n}+ \Delta t\sum_{i=1}^{N_n} S_{ip}\vect{\dot{v}}^{i}
\end{equation}
while the updated nodal velocities resulting from the solution of \eqref{eq:mpm_discrete} are used to update the particles positions:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:position_update}
  \vect{x}^{p,n+1}=\vect{x}^{p,n} + \Delta t\sum_{i=1}^{N_n} S_{ip}\vect{v}^{i,n+1} 
\end{equation}

The integration of constitutive equations is performed at material points based on the nodal velocity field and the gradient of shape functions. Hence, one has some freedom in the way in which the stress is computed since it can be done right after either the resolution of \eqref{eq:mpm_discrete} or the projection \eqref{eq:particles2nodes}. The first option yields the \textit{Update Stress Last} (USL) algorithm while the second implementation is called \textit{Update Stress First} (USF) \cite{Bardenhagen_USF_USL}. 

The solution of discrete equations on the background grid requires the enforcement of boundary conditions at nodes. While Neumann boundary conditions are prescribed through the external force vector (equation \eqref{eq:ext_forces}), Dirichlet boundary conditions have to be imposed on both nodal acceleration and velocity in order to consistently update the kinematics and constitutive equations at material points. The enforcement of boundary condition is still a chalenging aspect of the material point method (as others mesh-free methods) for problems involving complex geometries, see for instance \cite{Bcs_MPM}. However, we consider here problems that do not require a particular treatment of boundary conditions.

\subsubsection{Solution scheme summary}
Let us assume that position and velocity vectors  $\vect{x}^n$ and $\vect{v}^n$ are known at every material points that discretize the continuum body in the grid at time $t^n$. Moreover, the USL implementation of the method also requires the knowledge of the specific stress tensor $\tens{\bar{\sigma}}^n$ at material points. The MPM solution scheme then consists of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Computation of the consistent and lumped mass matrices and external forces (Neumann boundary conditions) from equations \eqref{eq:mass_matrix} and \eqref{eq:ext_forces}.
\item[(b)] Convective phase: projection of fields to the grid \eqref{eq:particles2nodes} and enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions on the nodal velocity. For USF formulation, the enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions on the mesh is required so that the integration of constitutive equations can be done.
\item[(c)] Evaluation of internal forces from equation \eqref{eq:int_forces}.
\item[(d)] Solution of the semi-discrete and discrete forms \eqref{eq:mpm_semi-discrete} and \eqref{eq:mpm_discrete} so that nodal accelerations $\vect{\dot{v}}^i$ and updated velocities $\vect{v}^{i,n+1}$ are determined. Enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions: set the velocity of boundary nodes to the prescribed values and their accelerations to zero.
\item[(e)] Update the material points velocities and positions with equations \eqref{eq:mp_velocity_update} and \eqref{eq:position_update} respectively. At this point the mesh has virtually moved, but since fields have been transferred back to particles, the underlying grid can be discarded and rebuilt for the next time step for computational convenience, thus involving the convective phase (b) at the next time step. 
\item[(f)] If the USL implementation is set, constitutive equations must be integrated.
\end{itemize}

Although the material point method has been successfully applied to a wide range of complex large strain engineering problems involving finite deformations \cite{Wieckowski}, this approach suffers from limitations which are discussed in the next section. 

\subsection{Shortcomings of the MPM}

%% Quick way
%The computation of internal forces within the MPM may lead to the well-known \textit{grid-crossing} instability due to the discontinuity of the gradient of shape functions when material points move from one cell to another \cite{Gimp}. The \textbf{Generalized Interpolation Material Point method} (GIMP) \cite{Gimp}, the \textbf{B-Spline Material Point Method} (BSMPM) \cite{Steffen_quadError} and the \textbf{Dual Domain Material Point Method} (DDMPM) \cite{DDMPM0} addressed this issue respectively by: (i) changing the particles characteristic function; (ii) enriching the approximation basis with quadratic or cubic B-Spline functions; (iii) introducing a modified gradient of shape functions. 

\subsubsection*{The grid-crossing instability}
The research on MPM mainly focused so far on the instability arising from the computation of internal forces when material points move from one cell to another due to the discontinuity of the gradient of shape functions across element interfaces, the so-called \textit{grid-crossing} error \cite{Gimp}. The \textbf{Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method} (GIMP) addressed this numerical issue by modifying the particles characteristic function, thus widening the domain of influence of material points \cite{Gimp}. By doing so, every particle are given a domain having either a constant shape (the uGIMP formulation) or not (the cpGIMP formulation), that must be tracked during the computation. In the cpGimp algorithm, only diagonal entries of the deformation gradient are used to update the "shapes" of particles. The \textbf{Convected Particle Domain Interpolation} (CPDI) \cite{CPDI} has then been developed to account for shear deformations an rotations of particles domains, thus providing an improvement of GIMP. However, those methods involve other difficulties related to the tracking of the deforming domains material points in the Eulerian grid which leads to mesh entanglement issues \cite{DDMPM0}. As a consequence, other ways consisting in the direct modification of the approximation basis have been followed to tackle the grid-crossing error. First, the \textbf{B-Spline Material Point Method} (BSMPM) \cite{Steffen_quadError} uses quadratic or cubic B-Spline functions with continuous gradients as nodal shape functions which allow to circumvent the instability \cite{MPM_BSpline1}. Second, the classical approximation basis is used and modified gradients with extended supports are introduced in the \textbf{Dual Domain Material Point Method} (DDMPM) \cite{DDMPM0}. These approaches both solve the grid-crossing error by widening the domain of influence of material points since B-Spline functions span more cells than Lagrange polynomials and the supports of the modified gradients of the DDMPM are larger than those of the shape functions.  

\subsubsection*{The back-mapping instability}
Numerical noise also appears in the MPM solution for problems that do not involve the grid-crossing instability. As an illustration of the previous remark, let us consider a one-dimensional elastic bar of length $L=6\:m$ with Young's modulus $E=200 \:GPa$ and mass density $\rho=7800 \:kg\cdot m^{-3}$ within the infinitesimal theory. The bar is initially in a free stress state and Riemann-type initial velocities are prescribed along the bar, that is: $v=v_0>0$ for $x\in[0,L/2]$ and $v=-v_0$ for $x \in [L/2,L]$. Both ends of the bar are traction free so that this problem is equivalent to an impact of two elastic bars moving toward each other. The analytical solution of this problem (see section \ref{subsec:charac_Linear_problems}) consists of two elastic discontinuities emanating from the middle of the bar and propagating left and rightward. Numerical results provided by the USL and USF implementations of the MPM are compared to the exact solution before reflection of the waves on the boundaries in figure \ref{fig:US_diffusion}. The computational grid is composed of $50$ regular cells, each containing either one or two material points ($1\: ppc$ or $2\: ppc$). Single material points are centered in cells while "cellmate" particles are placed symmetrically with respect to elements centers and are regularly spaced.

  \label{fig:US_diffusion}
\end{figure}
Figures \ref{fig:US_diffusion}\subref{subfig:US_diffusion_10} and \ref{fig:US_diffusion}\subref{subfig:US_diffusion_25} show that both USL and USF solutions oscillate after the passage of the elastic front. Those oscillations are much more significant in the USF solutions regardless of the number of particles used. Indeed, the noise in USL results quickly reduces so that the correct stress level is reached in the middle region of the bar. Moreover, even though the $1\: ppc$ and $2\: ppc$ discretizations provide different results (slightly different for USL), neither of them enables the removal of oscillations. Figure \ref{fig:US_diffusion}\subref{subfig:US_energies} shows, on the other hand, the evolutions of numerical total energies. Note that the total energy results from an MPM approximation of kinetic and strain energies, respectively defined as:
\begin{align}
  & e^{kin}=\frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega \rho \vect{v}\cdot\vect{v} \:d\Omega \approx \frac{1}{2}\sum_p m_p \vect{v}^p\cdot\vect{v}^p\\
& e^{strain}= \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega \rho \tens{\bar{\sigma}}: \nablav \vect{v} \:d\Omega \approx \frac{1}{2}\sum_p m_p \tens{\bar{\sigma}}^p: \nablav \vect{v}^p
\end{align}
One can see that the USL formulation is more diffusive than the USF for this problem. These results differ from observations made in \cite{Bardenhagen_USF_USL}, in which no significant difference appears in energy plots for problems involving smooth solutions. At last, figure \ref{fig:US_velocities} compares the numerical velocities to the exact solution at various time steps. The same pattern than that observed for stresses is seen in figures \ref{fig:US_velocities}\subref{subfig:US_velo_10} and \ref{fig:US_velocities}\subref{subfig:US_velo_25} for velocities, namely, numerical oscillations in both USL and USF solutions with bigger picks in the USF ones. 

A notable numerical artifact that prevents the proper assessment of the velocity occurs at the middle of the bar. This issue is not due to the computation of internal forces since the symmetrical stress solutions plotted in figures \ref{fig:US_diffusion}\subref{subfig:US_diffusion_10} and \ref{fig:US_diffusion}\subref{subfig:US_diffusion_25}, combined to the discontinuous gradient of shape functions, yield zero internal forces at the central node of the computational grid (equation \eqref{eq:int_forces}). Furthermore, a skew-symmetric velocity solution leads, after the convective step, to a zero velocity at the central node, which is the correct solution (and never changes because of null internal forces). Hence, the error most likely comes from the back-mapping of fields from the grid to material points.

  \caption{Comparison between exact, USF and USL velocities of the bars impact problem for various discretizations.}
  \label{fig:US_velocities}
\end{figure}

Since the back-mapping has been identified as being responsible for noise in the numerical solution in \cite{Mass_Flip}, the original projection from the grid to particles used in PIC may be introduced within the MPM. Instead of updating the material points velocities according to equation \eqref{eq:mp_velocity_update}, the Lagrangian deform with the grid and their velocities are computed after the solution of discrete equations as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:PIC_Back-mapping}
  \vect{v}^{p,n+1}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_n} S_{ip}\vect{v}^{i,n+1}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the particles positions are updated in the same way by using the nodal velocity \eqref{eq:position_update}. By doing so, the particles displacements exactly satisfy the relation $\vect{\dot{x}}^p=\vect{v}^p$, which is not the case in MPM. Moreover, the writing of the weak form \eqref{eq:mpm_discrete_weak} has been based on the definition \eqref{eq:PIC_Back-mapping} so that this projection seems more consistent than the update \eqref{eq:mp_velocity_update}. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Comparison between USL algorithm with classical or PIC mapping and exact velocities of the bars impact problem for various discretizations.}
  \label{fig:MPM_velocities}
\end{figure}
Thus, the PIC projection \eqref{eq:PIC_Back-mapping} has been implemented into the USL formulation in order to compare it to the original USL algorithm and to the exact solution (figures \ref{fig:MPM_velocities}\subref{subfig:MPM_velo_10} and \ref{fig:MPM_velocities}\subref{subfig:MPM_velo_10}). As can be seen, the introduction of the PIC projection enables the elimination of noise in the numerical solution as well as the "locking" of the velocity in the middle region of the bar. Hence, the modified USL shows a good agreement with the exact solution in terms of velocity and stress (see figures \ref{fig:mpm_diffusion}\subref{subfig:mpm_diffusion_10} and \ref{fig:mpm_diffusion}\subref{subfig:mpm_diffusion_25}). Nevertheless, the modified USL is more diffusive, as shown in figure \ref{fig:mpm_diffusion}\subref{subfig:mpm_energies}. This result was expected since the PIC projection step was removed in order to reduce the numerical dissipation \cite{PIC_Nishiguchi}.

\subsection{Strategy for reducing oscillations and diffusion}
In this, we are concerned here with the accurate solution of hyperbolic problems in solid undergoing finite deformations. Although the MPM enables an efficient management of large strains, the oscillations it suffers from do not allow to accurately capture waves propagating in a medium. The above numerical results however suggest that the numerical noise can be removed by using an interpolation instead of an update of material points velocity, at the cost of additional diffusion. The point of view adopted in this thesis is that the numerical diffusion is essentially due to the projection of fields from particles to nodes and back tha spread the information. Hence, a reduction of the domain of influence of material points is preferred to a widening, as GIMP, BSMPM and DDMPM propose. 
As a consequence, a combination of the  \textit{Discontinuous Galerkin} approximation (DG) and the transfer of velocity from nodes to particles originally developed for PIC is proposed within the MPM. These two features are expected to respectively enable numerical diffusion and spurious osccilations. It is worth noticing that attention is paid to impact problems which solutions are mostly unregular so that high-order approximations, as investigated in \cite{MPM_BSpline2} or \cite{BsplineMPM}, are not considered here.
