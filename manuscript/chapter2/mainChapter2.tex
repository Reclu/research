\section{Introduction}
This chapter starts with generalities about systems of partial differential equations. In particular, the notions of \textit{characteristics} and \textit{hyperbolicity} is introduced in section \ref{sec:PDEs} for first order systems which will be of particular interest in the following of the manuscript.
Then, introduction of balance laws of solid dynamics and derivation of constitutive equations from the thermodynamics will lead to an hyperbolic system (section \ref{sec:solidMech_equations}). By using tools introduced in section \ref{sec:PDEs}, the characteristic analysis of such systems is carried out in section \ref{sec:characteristic_analysis} in order to derive solutions of particular problems allowing to highlight different types of \textit{waves}: (i) a one-dimensional linear problem is first studied (linear elastic bar) so that the \textit{Rankine-Hugoniot} jump condition is introduced (ii) \textit{shock} and \textit{simple} waves are then considered with a nonlinear problem (one-dimensional strain state in a \textit{Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff} hyperelastic material). At last, strategies enabling the computation of approximate solutions of nonlinear problems are reviewed.
