\section*{Introduction}
In this chapter, generalities about systems of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are first introduced. More specifically, the notions of \textit{characteristics} and \textit{hyperbolicity} for PDE are introduced in section \ref{sec:PDEs} for first-order systems, which will be of particular interest in the remainder of the manuscript.
Then, introduction of balance laws of solid dynamics and derivation of constitutive equations from the thermodynamics in section \ref{sec:solidMech_equations}, lead to first-order hyperbolic PDE.
By using tools introduced in section \ref{sec:PDEs}, the characteristic analysis of those systems is carried out in section \ref{sec:characteristic_analysis} in order to derive exact solutions of particular problems in section \ref{sec:riemann_problems}. Those solutions allow the highlighting of different types of waves: (i) discontinuous waves, governed by the \textit{Rankine-Hugoniot} jump condition, within one-dimensional linear elastic and elastic-plastic media (ii) shock waves, also following the Rankine-Hugoniot condition, and simple waves, within a non-linear problem (one-dimensional strain state in a \textit{Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff} hyperelastic medium).
At last, strategies enabling the computation of approximate solutions of non-linear problems are reviewed in section \ref{sec:riemann_solvers}.

\section{Conclusion}
It has been seen in this chapter that solid dynamics balance equations can be written as a first order hyperbolic system whose theory has been recalled in section \ref{sec:PDEs}.
Indeed, the thermodynamics framework assuming generalized standard materials combined with conservation laws allowed in section \ref{sec:solidMech_equations} the building of conservative or quasi-linear forms.
Those systems of partial differential equations admit non-complex eigenvalues and independent eigenvectors provided that some requirements on the stored energy function are satisfied (positive definiteness of the acoustic tensor).
Then, the characteristic analysis of the quasi-linear form in section \ref{sec:characteristic_analysis} enabled the highlighting of specific wave types involved in the solutions of dynamic problems, that is: discontinuous, shock and simple waves.
Even though exact solutions of linear and non-linear problems have been developed in section \ref{sec:riemann_problems}, it is not possible in general, hence the introduction of approximate-state Riemann solvers in section \ref{sec:riemann_solvers}.
This solution strategy will be used in what follows as an element of the \textit{Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method}, which is the object of the next chapter.
