In this section, the mathematical laws allowing the description of the deformation of a solid body will be derived. First, the kinematic laws governing the motion of each material point belonging to a solid will be considered. The variations of lengths and shapes of a continuum, described by the \textit{strain} mesure will then be associated to internal forces through thermodynamic framework. Finally, the theory of first order quasi-linear partial differential system will be applied to solid dynamics in order to deliver analytical solutions for specific problems. The literature on the subject being very rich (see for instance \cite[Chapters~1-3]{Foundation_of_elasticity}, \cite{Truesdell}, \cite[Chapter~7]{Simo}, \cite[Chapters~3 \& 5]{Belytschko}), the governing equations of mechanics will be developed non-exhaustively.

\subsection{Kinematic laws -- Strain mesures}
We consider a three-dimensional solid domain with volume denoted by $\Omega \subset \Rbb^3$ bounded by the surface $\partial \Omega$. This body undergoes external sollicitations that can either be localized on a part of the external surface of the body (\textit{i.e. surface forces}) or act in the whole solid domain (\textit{i.e. volume forces}). Due to the presence of such sollicitations, the volume may change during a deformation within the time interval $\tau = \[0,T\]$ and will hence be written as a function of time $\Omega(t)$ ($t\in \tau$). The state of the solid at time $t=0$, corresponding to a non-deformed state with volume $\Omega(t=0)=\Omega_0$, is referred to as the \textit{initial configuration}. Some problems require the use of a \textit{reference configuration} that can be deformed and to which equations are referred. In what follows, the reference and initial conditions are identical. At a given time $t>0$, the volume $\Omega(t)=\Omega_t$ corresponds to the \textit{current configuration}. These configurations are depicted in figure \ref{fig:deformationFunction}.
\begin{figure}[h]

  \input{chapter2/pgfFigures/deformationFunction}
  \caption{Deformation of a solid body between a reference state $\Omega_0$ to a subsequent state $\Omega_t$.}
  \label{fig:deformationFunction}
\end{figure}

In the reference configuration, every material particle is located by their position vectors: $\vect{X}=X_\alpha \vect{e}_\alpha$, where $X_\alpha$ denotes the \textit{Lagrangian coordinates} and $\vect{e}_\alpha$ the basis vectors. At a subsequent time $t$, the particle initially located at $\vect{X}$ may have moved and its current location is given by the smooth mapping $\vect{\phi}(\vect{X},t)=\phi_i(\vect{X},t)\vect{e}_i$. Thus, the mapping $\vect{\phi}$ provides the paths of every particle of the solid during the deformation. In the lagrangian coordinates system, every particles are tracked during the deformation while the \textit{Eulerian coordinates}, denoted by $\vect{x}=x_i\vect{e}_i$, correspond to a \textit{spatial description}.
Note that in the above definitions Greek indices are used for quantities evaluated in the reference configuration whereas Latin ones refer to quantities defined in the current configuration. 

The \textit{displacement} and \textit{velocity} vectors of a particle between the reference and the current configuration are respectively:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    &\vect{u}(\vect{X},t)=\vect{\phi}(\vect{X},t) - \vect{X} \qquad \forall\:\: \vect{X},t \in \Omega_0\times \tau  \label{eq:displacement}\\
    &\vect{v}(\vect{X},t)=\drond{\vect{\phi}}{t}(\vect{X},t) = \vect{\dot{\phi}}(\vect{X},t) \qquad  \forall\: \: \vect{X},t \in \Omega_0\times \tau  \label{eq:velocity}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
where the superposed dot denotes the material time derivative. Then, the second-order two-point \textit{deformation gradient} tensor is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:F_phi}
    \tens{F}=\nablat_0 \vect{\phi} (\vect{X},t)
\end{equation}
where $\nablat_0 (\bullet)$ refers to the gradient operator on the reference configuration. This tensor can also be written by using equation \eqref{eq:displacement}:
\begin{equation}
  \tens{F}= \nablat_0 \vect{u}(\vect{X},t) + \tens{I} \label{eq:F_displacement}
\end{equation}
with $\tens{I}$, the second-order identity tensor. The deformation gradient tensor characterizes the variations of lengths, areas and volumes. Indeed, the infinitesimal vector, oriented surface and volume elements respectively denoted by $\vect{dX},\vect{dS}$ and $dV$ and defined in the reference configuration transorm respectively to:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:transport_equations}
  \begin{aligned}
    & dx_i=F_{i\alpha}dX_\alpha \\
    & ds_i=J F_{\alpha i}^{-1}dS_{\alpha} \\
    & dv=JdV 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
in the current configuration. The transport equations \eqref{eq:transport_equations} involve the determinant of the deformation gradient $J=\det(\tens{F})>0$, also called the \textit{Jacobian of the deformation}. The deformation gradient is a strain mesure since it accounts for changes in lengths and angles (\textit{i.e. the change of shape of a body}). Other strain mesures can be used as the \textit{right Cauchy-Green} or the \textit{Green-Lagrange} tensors, respectively defined as:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \tens{C}=\tens{F}^T\tens{F} \\
    & \tens{E}=\frac{1}{2}(\tens{C}-\tens{I})
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $\tens{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. The Green-Lagrange tensor can also be written by means of equation \eqref{eq:F_displacement}:
\begin{equation*}
  \tens{E}=\frac{1}{2}(\nablat_0 \vect{u} + \nablat_0 \vect{u}^T + \nablat_0 \vect{u}\nablat_0 \vect{u}^T)
\end{equation*}
In particular, when the deformation involves displacement vectors such that $\norm{\nablat_0 \vect{u}} \ll 1$, the last (second-order) term of the previous definition can be neglected leading to:
\begin{equation*}
  \tens{E} \approx \frac{1}{2}(\nablat_0 \vect{u} + \nablat_0 \vect{u}^T) = \tens{\eps}
\end{equation*}
with $\tens{\eps}$ the \textit{linearized strain tensor}, the symmetric part of the displacement gradient. Such deformations fall in the \textit{linearized geometrical framework} and are characterized by small strain but possibly large displacements. Furthermore, when the deformation leads to a displacement vector $\norm{\vect{u}} \ll 1$ reference and current configurations are considered as indentical. These situations correspond to the \textit{small strain} framework for which the reference and current configurations are considered as identical.

\subsection{Balance equations}
In this section a solid domain $\Omega(t)$ undergoing a deformation is still considered within the time interval $\tau = \[0,T\]$. We start the development of balance laws that hold in the continuum during the deformation by the conservation of mass of a conntinuum, which in integral form reads:
\begin{equation*}
  \int_\Omega \rho d\Omega = \int_{\Omega_0} \rho_0 d\Omega \qquad \forall \: t \in  \tau
\end{equation*}
which, with the third transport formula reads:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mass_conservation_law}
  \int_{\Omega_0} \(J\rho - \rho_0\) d\Omega = 0
\end{equation}
Leading to the first balance equation, namely the local conservation of mass:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mass_balance}
  \rho = \frac{\rho_0}{J} \qquad \forall \: \vect{X},t \: \in \Omega_0\times \tau
\end{equation}

We now move on to the equilibrium between acceleration effects, namely \textit{intertia}, and external forces undergone by a solid $\Omega$. This conservation law corresponds to \textit{Newton's second law}:
\begin{equation*}
  \int_\Omega \rho \vect{\dot{v}} d\Omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} \vect{t} dS + \int_{\Omega} \rho\vect{b}d\Omega \qquad \forall \: t \in  \tau
\end{equation*}
where $\vect{t}$ denotes surface forces and $vect{b}$ volume forces in the current configuration. We then introduce the symetric second-order \textit{Cauchy stress tensor} $\tens{\sigma}$ by using Cauchy's theorem $\vect{t}=\tens{\sigma}\cdot \vect{n}$ where $\vect{n}$ is the outwerd normal vector to the surface element $dS$. 

For further developments, the divergence theorem is required:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Ostrogradski_th}
  \int_{\partial \Omega} (\bullet)\cdot \vect{dS}=\int_\Omega \nablav \cdot (\bullet) \: d\Omega
\end{equation}
where $\nablav \cdot (\bullet)$ denotes the divergence operator on the current configuration. Introduction of the previous formula in the second law of Newton leads to:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Linear_momentum_conservation_eulerian}
  \int_{\Omega} \( \rho \vect{\dot{v}} - \nablav \cdot \tens{\sigma} -  \rho\vect{b} \) d\Omega = \vect{0} \qquad \forall \:t \in  \tau
\end{equation}
Conservation law \eqref{eq:Linear_momentum_conservation_eulerian} can be mapped to the reference configuration by using the transport formula of volume elements and the mass balance equation \eqref{eq:mass_balance}, thus yielding:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Linear_momentum_conservation}
  \int_{\Omega_0} \( \rho_0 \vect{\dot{v}} - J \nablav \cdot \tens{\sigma} -  \rho_0\vect{b} \) d\Omega = \vect{0} \qquad \forall \: t \in\tau
\end{equation}
In equation \eqref{eq:Linear_momentum_conservation}, the divergence operator on the current configuration can be transported to the reference one by means of the \textit{Piola transform}:
\begin{definition}
  The Piola--Kirchhoff tranform $\tens{T}^P$ of a second-order tensor $\tens{T}$ is defined as:
  \begin{equation*}
    \tens{T}^P=J\tens{T}\cdot\tens{F}^{-1}
  \end{equation*}
  and satisfies:
  \begin{equation*}
    \nablav_0\cdot \tens{T}^P = J \nablav \cdot \tens{T}
  \end{equation*}
  where $\nablav_0\cdot (\bullet)$ is the divergence operator on the reference configuration.
\end{definition}
Another stress mesure that corresponds to the Piola transform of Cauchy stress tensor is thus introduced, the \textit{first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor} $\tens{\Pi}=J\tens{\sigma}\cdot\tens{F}^{-1}$. Hence, the vanishing of the integrand in equation \eqref{eq:Linear_momentum_conservation} yields the balance equation of the \textit{lagrangian linear momentum}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Lagrangian_linear_momentum}
  \rho_0 \vect{\dot{v}} - \nablav_0 \cdot \tens{\Pi} = \rho_0 \vect{b} \qquad \forall \: \: \vect{X},t \in \Omega_0 \times \tau 
\end{equation}
When considering deformations within the small strain framework the balance equation of linear momentum can be deduced from equation \eqref{eq:Linear_momentum_conservation_eulerian}, leading to:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:HPP_linear_momentum}
  \rho \vect{\dot{v}} - \nablav \cdot \tens{\sigma} = \rho \vect{b}  \qquad \forall \: \: \vect{x},t \in \Omega \times \tau 
\end{equation}

We complete the set of balance laws by considering the conservation of the energy of a system, also known as the \textit{first law of thermodynamics}. This law relates a balance between the rates of change of \textit{kinetic} and \textit{internal} energies, the power of external forces and the amount of heat entering the system as \textit{volume} or \textit{surface heat sources}.
\begin{equation*}
  \ddroit{}{t}\int_{\Omega} \(\frac{1}{2}\rho \vect{v}\cdot\vect{v} + \rho e\) d\Omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} \(\tens{\sigma}\cdot\vect{n}\)\cdot\vect{v} \: dS + \int_{\Omega} \rho\vect{b}\cdot\vect{v} \: d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \rho r \:d\Omega - \int_{\partial \Omega} \vect{q}\cdot\vect{n} \: dS \qquad \forall \: t \in  \tau 
\end{equation*}
where $\vect{q}$ is the outward heat flux vector and $r$ is a volume heat source. By using the divergence theorem \eqref{eq:Ostrogradski_th}, the previous equation reads:
\begin{equation*}
\ddroit{}{t}\int_{\Omega} \(\frac{1}{2}\rho \vect{v}\cdot\vect{v} + \rho e\) d\Omega = \int_{\Omega} \(\nablav\cdot(\tens{\sigma}\cdot\vect{v}) +  \rho\vect{b}\cdot\vect{v} \) d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \rho r \: d\Omega  - \int_{\partial \Omega} \vect{q}\cdot\vect{n} \: dS \qquad \forall \: t \in  \tau 
\end{equation*}
The transport of this relation on the reference configuration based on \eqref{eq:transport_equations} allows to introduce the time derivative of the left-hand side in the integral
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\Omega_0} \(\rho_0 \vect{\dot{v}} + \rho_0 \dot{e}\) d\Omega = \int_{\Omega_0} \(J\nablav\cdot(\tens{\sigma}\cdot\vect{v}) +  \rho_0\vect{b}\cdot\vect{v} \) d\Omega + \int_{\Omega_0} \rho_0 r \:d\Omega- \int_{\partial \Omega_0} J\vect{q}\cdot \tens{F}^{-1}\cdot\vect{n} \: dS \qquad \forall \: t \in  \tau 
\end{equation*}
Then, substitution of the linear momentum according to equation \eqref{eq:Lagrangian_linear_momentum} yields, after some algebra, the conservation law of internal energy:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:conservation_law_energy}
  \int_{\Omega_0} \rho_0 \dot{e} d\Omega = \int_{\Omega_0} \tens{\Pi}:\nablat_0\vect{v}\: d\Omega + \int_{\Omega_0} \(\rho_0r  - \nablav_0 \cdot \vect{Q}\) d\Omega \qquad \forall \: t \in  \tau 
\end{equation}
where $\vect{Q}=J\vect{q}\cdot \tens{F}^{-1}$ is the lagrangian heat flux vector. We thus deduce the balance equation of internal energy on the reference configuration:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy_balance}
  \rho_0 \dot{e} -  \tens{\Pi}:\nablat_0\vect{v}  + \nablav_0 \cdot \vect{Q}  = r \qquad \forall \: \: \vect{X},t \in \Omega_0 \times \tau 
\end{equation}
where $\nablat_0\vect{v} = \tens{\dot{F}}$. Finally, the small strain version of equation \eqref{eq:energy_balance} is: 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy_balance}
  \rho \dot{e} -  \tens{\sigma}:\nablat^{s} \vect{v}  + \nablav \cdot \vect{q}  = r \qquad \forall \: \: \vect{x},t \in \Omega \times \tau 
\end{equation}
in which $\nablat^{s} (\bullet)$ denotes the symetric part of the gradient, in particular: $\nablat^s \vect{v} = \tens{\dot{\eps}}$. Stress mesures are conjugate to strain mesures through the power. In what follows, stress and strain may respectively be refered to as \textit{thermodynamic forces} and \textit{internal variables} according to the thermodynamics framework. The former obey a \textit{state equation} while the latter describe the evolution of the thermodynamic system. 
\subsection{Constitutive equations}
The closure of a problem is given by the constitutive equations (\textit{i.e state laws}) for the stress. Once and for all, we consider here constitutive models within the \textit{Generalized Standard Materials} (GSM) framework \cite{GSM}.

\subsubsection*{The general (hyper)elasticity formulation}
First, the \textit{Clausius-Duhem} inequality resulting from combination of first and second laws of thermodynamics, reads: 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Clausius-Duhem}
  \underbrace{\phantom{\frac{1}{\theta}} \tens{\Pi}:\tens{\dot{F}} + \rho_0 \(\theta \dot{\eta} -\dot{e}\)}_{\Dc^{int}} \:-\:  \underbrace{\frac{1}{\theta} \vect{q} \cdot \nablav_0 \theta}_{-\Dc^{th}} \geq 0  \qquad \forall \: \: \vect{X},t \in \Omega_0 \times \tau 
\end{equation}
where $\Dc^{int}$ and $\Dc^{th}$ are respectively the specific mechanical and thermal dissipations, and $\eta, \theta$ denote \textit{entropy} and \textit{temperature}. Equation \eqref{eq:Clausius-Duhem} results in vanishing dissipations for \textit{reversible} processes and in a strict inequality for \textit{irreversible} ones. Furthermore, a widely used assumption consists in considering that the mechanical and thermal dissipations simultaneously satisfy non-negativeness. Note that the \textit{Fourier's law} of conduction is based on the non-negativeness of the thermal dissipation and leads to the following definition of the heat flux vector in order to ensure the positivity of the thermal dissipation:
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:Fourier_law}
  \vect{q}=-\tens{k}\cdot\nablav_0 \theta
\end{equation*}


We assume the existence of a \textit{Helmholtz free energy density potential} $\psi\(\tens{F},\theta,V_p\)$ where the $V_p$ $(1\leq p \leq N)$ are additional state variables describing irreversible processes. The free energy is supposed concave with respect to temperature and convex with respect to other variables. The mechanical dissipation then can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation*}
  \Dc^{int} = \tens{\Pi}:\tens{\dot{F}} - \rho_0 \(\dot{\psi} +\eta \dot{\theta}\) 
\end{equation*}
The time derivative of Helmholtz free energy:
\begin{equation*}
  \dot{\psi} = \drond{\psi}{\tens{F}}:\tens{\dot{F}} + \drond{\psi}{\theta}\dot{\theta} + \drond{\psi}{V_p}\dot{V_p}
\end{equation*}
can be introduced within the mechanical dissipation so that one gets:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Dint_psi_factor}
  \Dc^{int} = \(\tens{\Pi}- \rho_0 \drond{\psi}{\tens{F}} \):\tens{\dot{F}} - \rho_0 \(\drond{\psi}{\theta} +\eta\) \dot{\theta}  - \rho_0\drond{\psi}{V_p}\dot{V_p} 
\end{equation}


Since the mechanical dissipation must be non-negative regardless of the nature of the deformation, it must in particular vanish for a reversible isothermal process (\textit{i.e. $\theta=const$}) for which every additional internal variables are constant. With these considerations, we are left with the relation:
\begin{equation*}
  \( \tens{\Pi} - \rho_0\drond{\psi}{\tens{F}} \): \tens{\dot{F}} = 0
\end{equation*}
holding regardless of the deformation, and hence:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:PK1_definition}
  \rho_0\drond{\psi}{\tens{F}} = \tens{\Pi}
\end{equation}
A material is said \textit{hyperelastic} if the above stress state law is satisfied \cite[p.8]{Foundation_of_elasticity}. Equivalently we have for linear elasticity:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Cauchy_definition}
  \rho \drond{\psi}{\tens{\eps}} = \tens{\sigma}
\end{equation}

Similar considerations lead to the state laws for entropy and for additional thermodynamic forces :
\begin{equation*}
  %\label{eq:entropy_definition}
  \drond{\psi}{\theta} = - \eta \quad ; \quad \rho_0\drond{\psi}{V_p}=A_p
\end{equation*}

In what follows, we shall consider hyperelastic or linear elastic deformations that do not involve irreversible processes (\textit{e.g. damage or thermal softening}). Hence, additional internal variables and associated thermodynamic forces are not activated in such situations. However, the cases of \textit{elastoplasticity} and \textit{elasto-viscoplasticity}, involving such variables and forces, will be considered in the linearized geometrical framework.

\subsection{The general formulation}
We introduced above for the general case the balance equations of linear momentum \eqref{eq:Lagrangian_linear_momentum} and internal energy \eqref{eq:energy_balance}. Moreover, state equations of thermodynamic forces have been derived (equation \eqref{eq:PK1_definition} for stress and equation \eqref{eq:entropy_definition} for entropy). Those thermodynamic forces are dual quantities of internal variables (respectively strain and temperature) which variations govern the evolution of the system. Whereas the evolution of the deformation gradient is given by lagrangian kinematic law \eqref{eq:F_phi} written in rate form, the evolution of the temperature is governed by the well-known \textit{heat equation}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:heat_equation}
  \rho_0 C \dot{\theta} = r - \nablav \cdot \vect{q} - \rho_0 \drond{\psi}{V_p}\dot{V_p} + \theta \(\drond{\tens{\Pi}}{\theta}:\tens{\dot{F}} - \drond{A_p}{\theta}\dot{V_p} \)
\end{equation}
For isothermal processes, the heat equation \eqref{eq:heat_equation} yields:
\begin{equation*}
  r - \nablav \cdot \vect{q} = \rho_0 \drond{\psi}{V_p}\dot{V_p} 
\end{equation*}
Also, such a deformation leads to the rate of change of internal energy:
\begin{align*}
  \rho_0 \dot{e} &= \rho_0 \( \dot{\psi} + \theta\dot{\eta}+\eta\dot{\theta}\) \\
                 &= \underbrace{\rho_0\drond{\psi}{\tens{F}}}_{=\tens{\Pi}}:\tens{\dot{F}} + \rho_0\underbrace{\drond{\psi}{\theta}}_{=-\eta}\dot{\theta} + \underbrace{\rho_0\drond{\psi}{V_p}}_{r - \nablav \cdot \vect{q}}\dot{V_p} + \rho_0\theta\dot{\eta}+\rho_0\eta\dot{\theta} \\
                 &= \tens{\Pi}:\tens{\dot{F}} +r - \nablav \cdot \vect{q}+ \rho_0\theta\dot{\eta}
\end{align*}
Furthermore, with equation \eqref{eq:entropy_definition} we see that for isothermal cases $\eta=0$. 
Finally we are left with:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:isoth_energy_balance}
  \rho_0 \dot{e} = \tens{\Pi}:\tens{\dot{F}} +r - \nablav \cdot \vect{q}  
\end{equation}
which identifies to the balance equation of internal energy \eqref{eq:energy_balance}. Hence, for isothermal deformation, the balance equation of internal energy is automatically satisfied.
Gathering the balance equations introduced above, we are left with the following system
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Hyp_conservation_laws_system}
  \left\lvert
    \begin{aligned}
      & \rho_0 \vect{\dot{v}} - \nablav_0 \cdot \tens{\Pi} =  \rho_0 \vect{b} \\
      & \tens{\dot{F}} - \nablav_0 \cdot \(\tens{I}\otimes \vect{v} \) = \tens{0} \\
      & \rho_0 \dot{e} - \tens{\Pi}:\tens{F}-\vect{q}  = r
    \end{aligned}
  \right.
\end{equation}
