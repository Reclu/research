In this section, the mathematical laws allowing the description of the deformation of a solid body will be derived. First, the kinematic laws governing the motion of each material point belonging to a solid will be considered. The variations of lengths and shapes of a continuum, described by the \textit{strain} mesure will then be associated to internal forces through thermodynamic framework. Finally, the theory of first order quasi-linear partial differential system will be applied to solid dynamics in order to deliver analytical solutions for specific problems.

\subsection{Kinematic laws -- Strain mesures}
We consider a three-dimensional solid domain with volume denoted by $\Omega \subset \Rbb^3$ bounded by the surface $\partial \Omega$. This body undergoes external sollicitations that can either be localized on a part of the external surface of the body (\textit{i.e. surface forces}) or act in the whole solid domain (\textit{i.e. volume forces}). Due to the presence of such sollicitations, the volume may change during a deformation within the time interval $\tau = \[0,T\]$ and will hence be written as a function of time $\Omega(t)$ ($t\in \tau$). The state of the solid at time $t=0$, corresponding to a non-deformed state with volume $\Omega(t=0)=\Omega_0$, is referred to as the \textit{initial configuration}. Some problems require the use of a \textit{reference configuration} that can be deformed and to which equations are referred. In what follows, the reference and initial conditions are identical. At a given time $t>0$, the volume $\Omega(t)=\Omega_t$ corresponds to the \textit{current configuration}. These configurations are depicted in figure \ref{fig:deformationFunction}.

\end{figure}

In the reference configuration, every material particle is located by their position vectors: $\X=X_\alpha \vect{e}_\alpha$, where $X_\alpha$ denotes the \textit{Lagrangian coordinates} and $\vect{e}_\alpha$ the basis vectors. At a subsequent time $t$, the particle initially located at $\X$ may have moved and its current location is given by the smooth mapping $\vect{\phi}(\X,t)=\phi_i(\X,t)\vect{e}_i$. Thus, the mapping $\vect{\phi}$ provides the paths of every particle of the solid during the deformation.
Note that in the above definitions Greek indices are used for quantities evaluated in the reference configuration whereas Latin ones refer to quantities defined in the current configuration. 

The \textit{displacement} and \textit{velocity} vectors of a particle between the reference and the current configuration are respectively:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    &\u(\X,t)=\vect{\phi}(\X,t) - \X \qquad \forall\:\: \X,t \in \Omega_0\times \tau  \label{eq:displacement}\\
    &\v(\X,t)=\drond{\vect{\phi}}{t}(\X,t) = \vect{\dot{\phi}}(\X,t) \qquad  \forall\: \: \X,t \in \Omega_0\times \tau  \label{eq:velocity}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
where the superposed dot denotes the material time derivative. Furthermore, the second-order two-point \textit{deformation gradient} tensor is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  F_{i\alpha}=\drond{\phi_i}{X_{\alpha}}(\X,t)  \label{eq:F_phi}
\end{equation}
or, by using equation \eqref{eq:displacement}:
\begin{equation}
  F_{i\alpha}= \drond{u_i}{X_\alpha} + \delta_{i\alpha} \label{eq:F_displacement}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{i\alpha}$ is the \textit{Kronecker} symbol. The deformation gradient tensor characterizes the variations of lengths, areas and volumes. Indeed, the infinitesimal vector, oriented surface and volume elements respectively denoted by $\vect{dX},\vect{dS}$ and $dV$ and defined in the reference configuration transorm respectively to:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:transport_equations}
  \begin{aligned}
    & dx_i=F_{i\alpha}dX_\alpha \\
    & ds_i=J F_{\alpha i}^{-1}dS_{\alpha} \\
    & dv=JdV 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
in the current configuration. The transport equations \eqref{eq:transport_equations} involve the determinant of the deformation gradient $J=\det(\tens{F})>0$, also called the \textit{Jacobian of the deformation}. The deformation gradient is a strain mesure since it accounts for changes in lengths and angles (\textit{i.e. the change of shape of a body}). Other strain mesures can be used as the \textit{right Cauchy-Green} or the \textit{Green-Lagrange} tensors, respectively defined as:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \tens{C}=\tens{F}^T\tens{F} \\
    & \tens{E}=\frac{1}{2}(\tens{C}-\tens{I})
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $\tens{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. %In the above intrinsic notations of second order tensors, the \textit{dot operator} corresponding to the \textit{simple contraction} of tensors has been omitted since there is no ambiguity.
The Green-Lagrange tensor can also be written by means of equation \eqref{eq:F_displacement}:
\begin{equation*}
  \tens{E}=\frac{1}{2}(\drond{\u}{\X} + \drond{\u}{\X}^T + \drond{\u}{\X}\drond{\u}{\X}^T)
\end{equation*}
In particular, when the deformation involves displacement vectors such that $\norm{\drond{\u}{\X}} \ll 1$, the last (second-order) term of the previous definition can be neglected leading to:
\begin{equation*}
  \tens{E} \approx \frac{1}{2}(\drond{\u}{\X} + \drond{\u}{\X}^T) = \tens{\eps}
\end{equation*}
with $\tens{\eps}$ the \textit{linearized strain tensor}. Such deformations fall in the \textit{linearized geometrical framework} and are characterized by small strain but possibly large displacements.
