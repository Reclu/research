\section*{Introduction}
It has been shown throughout this manuscript that hyperbolic problems of solid mechanics are solved in a different manner depending on the numerical explicit method employed. 
In particular, irreversible deformations which are usually computed numerically based on well-known constitutive integrators, may greatly differ from one scheme to another, even for one-dimensional problems.
However, the accurate assessment of residual stresses and strains are of major importance for many industrial applications such as, among others, high-speed metal forming, crash-proof design or the study of earthquakes impact on structures.
The simulations performed in chapter \ref{chap:chap4} emphasized the improvements enabled by the knowledge of the characteristic structure of the solution of conservation laws systems, especially for elastoplastic solids.
Nevertheless, the introduction of the exact solution by means of approximate Riemann solvers is so far only carried out for one-dimensional and specific multi-dimensional loading cases for elastic-plastic solids.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide solutions and clues for future works for more general two-dimensional elastoplasticity problems under small strains. 
More information on the structure of solutions to these problems allow a better understanding of physical phenomena occuring in media on the one hand, and the ability of accurately deal with them numerically on the other hand.
The chapter is organized as follows.
A brief historical review of the solution of plastic waves in two-dimension space is made in section \ref{sec:review}.
Then, the equations of plastic flow, which characteristic analysis is carried out, are recalled in section \ref{sec:charac_plast}.
Attention is next paid in section \ref{sec:stress_paths} to the evolution of stress components through simple waves possibly arising in the solution. 
Some thus identified loading paths are finally discussed in section \ref{sec:ep_Riemman_solver} in the context of the development of dedicated approximate Riemann solvers.

Parler du solver de Lin et Ballman qui cause problème dans le cas général mais je ne sais plus pourquoi...(je crois que c'est en lien avec des problèmes de Picard et non Riemann)
On propose ici d'approximer toutes les ondes simples par des discontinuités (motivé par les trajets de chargement tracés au-dessus)
