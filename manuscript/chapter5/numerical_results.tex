Although some properties of the simple waves have been emphasized in section \ref{sec:stress_paths}, the complexity of the equations prevents the complete characterization of the loading paths followed.
In order to get additional information on the evolution of the stress states, the systems of ODEs gathered in table \ref{tab:simpleWavesEquations} are here numerically integrated for plane stress and plane strain loadings. %, based on the material parameters used in chapter \ref{chap:chap3}.
In particular, the thin-walled tube problem considered by Clifton \cite{Clifton} is first looked at so that the above developments can be validated.
Next, the plane stress and plane strain cases are treated.
%The identified behaviors should provide some simplification assumptions for the building of a procedure that lead to approximate solutions of the problems.
The values of the elastic properties considered here are those use in the previous chapter (see table \ref{tab:material}).
On the other hand, the tensile yield stress $\sigma^y=10^{8} \: Pa$ and the hardening modulus $C=1\times10^8 \: Pa$ are set here arbitrarily.
Finally, we restrict here to positive shear stress $\sigma_{12}\geq 0$.
\subsection{Thin-walled tube problem}
\label{sec:num_thin-walled}
%% Hypothèses du problème
Consider the semi-infinite domain in Cartesian coordinate system: $x_1 \times x_2 \times x_3 \in [0,\infty[ \times [-h,h] \times [-e,e]$, being acted upon by a traction vector $\vect{T}^d$ at $x_1=0 $ and free surfaces $x_2=\pm h$ and $x_3=\pm e$.
Only the first two components of $\vect{T}^d$ are non-null so that the stress and strain tensor within the medium are of the form:
\begin{equation}
  \tens{\sigma} = \matrice{\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} & \\ \sigma_{12} & 0 & \\ & & 0} \quad ;\quad\tens{\eps} = \matrice{\eps_{11} & \eps_{12} & \\ \eps_{12} & \eps_{22}& \\ & & \eps_{33}}
\end{equation}
Such a state corresponds to that holding in a hollow cylinder with radius and length much bigger that its thickness, submitted to combined longitudinal and torsional loads.
Hence the name of thin-walled tube problem. 
As a particular plane stress case, the set of ODEs along characteristic derived in section \ref{sec:stress_paths} applies by nevertheless taking into account the vanishing stress component $\sigma_{22}$:
\begin{align*}
  & \dot{\sigma}_{22}=\widetilde{C}^{ep}_{22ij} \dot{\eps}_{ij} =0 \quad i,j=\{1,2\} \\
  \Rightarrow  \quad  &\widetilde{C}^{ep}_{2222} \dot{\eps}_{22} = - \widetilde{C}^{ep}_{22ij}\dot{\eps}_{ij} \quad ij=\{11,12,21\}
\end{align*}
where $\widetilde{\Cbb}^{ep}$ is the plane stress tangent modulus \eqref{eq:CP_constitutive}.
Thus, inverting the above equation and introducing it in the constitutive equation, we are left with the following law:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ch5_TW_tangent}
  \dot{\sigma}_{ij}=\widetilde{C}^{ep}_{ijkl} \dot{\eps}_{kl} - \frac{\widetilde{C}^{ep}_{ij22}\widetilde{C}^{ep}_{22kl}}{\widetilde{C}^{ep}_{2222}}\dot{\eps}_{kl}= \widehat{C}^{ep}_{ijkl} \dot{\eps}_{kl}\qquad ij,kl=\{11,12,21\} 
\end{equation}
%with $\widetilde{\Cbb}^{ep}$ is referred to as the thin-walled tube tangent modulus.
The characteristic analysis of the hyperbolic system based on this tangent modulus also leads to loading paths followed across slow and fast waves, involving however two components of stress rather than three. For the sake of simplicity, the stress components are denoted by $\sigma_{11}=\sigma$ and $\sigma_{12}=\tau$ whereas the velocity components reads $v_1=u$ and $v_2=v$.

Those equations as well as these of Clifton \cite{Clifton} have been numerically integrated, starting from several arbitrary points lying on the initial yield surface.
Since the loading functions are odd functions of $\sigma$ and $\tau$ \cite{Clifton}, the loading paths have axial symmetries.
Therefore the study is restricted to the quarter-plane $\sigma>0,\tau>0$.

  \label{fig:fast_clifton}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:fast_clifton} shows one stress path resulting from the integration of the ODE related to right-going fast waves with $\sigma$ used as a driving parameter.
The initial stress state lies on the yield surface at $\sigma=0$ and the ODE is discretized by means of backward Euler method, the integration being performed until the stress reaches the value $\sigma=\sigma^y$.
The path is respectively depicted in the stress space and in the deviatoric plane in figures \ref{fig:fast_clifton}\subref{subfig:tw_fast_stress} and \ref{fig:fast_clifton}\subref{subfig:tw_fast_dev}.
The deviatoric plane projection is obtained by drawing the paths in the eigenstresses space and projecting them onto the plane perpendicular to the hydrostatic axis $s_1+s_2+s_3=0$.
In this plane, the von-Mises yield surface is a cricle drawn with dashed lines.
%Furthermore, the direction of the path is given by the arrows in figure \ref{sec:stress_paths}.
Furthermore, as observed by Clifton, the path inside fast waves first follows the initial yield surface up to the intersection with the $\sigma$-axis.
Then, the loading path is such that $d\tau=0$ while $\sigma$ increase as far as hyperbolicity holds, that is for $c_f < c_2 = \sqrt{\mu/\rho} $ \cite{Clifton}.
Notice that these conclusions are similar to those made in the previous section.
The ODEs derived in section \ref{sec:stress_paths} for plane stresses, once adapted to the thin walled-tube problem, then allow to retrieve the solution originally proposed by Clifton.

Adopting the same approach with $\tau$ as driving parameter, some stress paths through slow waves have been reported in figure \ref{fig:tw_slow}.
Since fast waves lead to loading paths following the initial yield surface, the orthogonality property of the loading functions implies that these of slow waves mowe away from it.
It is seen in figure \ref{fig:tw_slow}\subref{subfig:tw_slow_stress}.
% Starting from several stress values along the initial yield surface, the orthogonality of the loading functions leads to stresses moving away from the elastic convex.
% Since the stress path in a fast wave follow the yield surface, those of a slow wave are perpendicular to the yield surface in figure \ref{fig:tw_slow}\subref{subfig:tw_slow_stress}.
This is however not the case in the deviatoric plane (\ref{fig:tw_slow}\subref{subfig:tw_slow_dev}) except for the initial condition $\sigma=0$ leads to a radial loading path following the direction of pure shear (horizontal dotted line in figure \ref{fig:tw_slow}\subref{subfig:tw_slow_dev}).
%Furthermore, we see that the initial condition $\sigma=0$ leads to a stress path following the direction of pure shear in the deviatoric plane (horizontal dotted line in figure \ref{fig:tw_slow}\subref{subfig:tw_slow_dev}).

\end{figure}


The behaviors highlighted above allow the solution of the Picard problem in a thin-walled cylinder, that is:
\begin{itemize}
\item initial conditions $\tens{\sigma}(\vect{x},t=0)=\tens{0}$, $\vect{v}(\vect{x},t=0)=\vect{0}$
\item step-loading boundary conditions $\sigma(x_1=0,t)=\sigma^d$ and $\tau(x_1=0,t)=\tau^d$
\end{itemize}
Indeed, with given ($\sigma^d,\tau^d$) outside of the initial yield surface, one can integrate backward the loading path through a simple wave for it is the slowest, and hence the last wave that can be met in the solution.
Then, if the integration leads to some point of the initial yield surface, which can be reached by elastic discontinuities, the solution is complete.
Conversely, if the slow wave connects ($\sigma^d,\tau^d$) to the $\sigma$-axis at some point lying outside of the initial yield surface, then a fast wave must be integrated backward to the initial elastic convex.
At last, the cases $\tau^d=0$ and $\sigma^d=0$ respectively lead to one single fast wave and one single slow wave.
Once the characteristic structure of the problem has been determined (\textit{i.e. one fast wave, one slow wave, or both}), the complete set of ODEs can be integrated in order to compute the solution.
It is worth emphasizing the complexity introduced by waves of combined stress since the characteristic structure of the solution of a Picard problem now depends on the boundary conditions.
Hence, for developing a Riemann solver that would provide the stationary solution, additional computational effort must be made.

The iterative procedure proposed by Lin and Ballman \cite{Lin_et_Ballman} to solve Riemann problems is based on the above considerations.
%Lin and Ballman \cite{Lin_et_Ballman} proposed an iterative procedure to solve Riemann problems with the stress states considered above.
The left and right initial conditions of that problem satisfy equations similar to \eqref{eq:integral_example}:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:lin_ballman}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:lin_ballman_left}
    & u^* = u^L + \int_{\tens{\sigma}^L}^{\tens{\sigma}^*} \frac{d\sigma}{\rho c} \quad ; \quad v^* = v^L + \int_{\tens{\sigma}^L}^{\tens{\sigma}^*} \frac{d\tau}{\rho c} \\
    \label{eq:lin_ballman_right}
    & u^* = u^R - \int_{\tens{\sigma}^R}^{\tens{\sigma}^*} \frac{d\sigma}{\rho c} \quad ; \quad v^* = v^R - \int_{\tens{\sigma}^R}^{\tens{\sigma}^*} \frac{d\tau}{\rho c}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
where the asterisk denotes the stationary state of the Riemann problem.
First, a stress state ($\bar{\sigma},\bar{\tau}$) is assumed to be connected to $\tens{\sigma}^L$ and $\tens{\sigma}^R$ (see figure \ref{fig:lin_et_ballman} for the illustration of the method).

  \caption{Schematic representation of the iterative Riemann solver proposed in \cite{Lin_et_Ballman}.}

\end{figure}
By taking into account the conclusions of Clifton the loading paths followed can be identified so that equations \eqref{eq:lin_ballman_left} and \eqref{eq:lin_ballman_right} can be integrated.
Thus, virtual integral curves are built in ($u,\sigma$) and ($v,\tau$) planes as depicted with dashed lines in figure \ref{fig:lin_et_ballman}.
Second, the intersection of the curves joining respectively $\vect{v}^L$ to $\vect{v}^1$ and $\vect{v}^R$ to $\vect{v}^2$ gives a stress state ($\widehat{\sigma},\widehat{\tau}$) that is used to apply the procedure again until some criterion $\norm{\vect{v}^1-\vect{v}^2}\leq \epsilon $ is achieved.
At last, the sate obtained $(\widehat{\vect{v}},\widehat{\tens{\sigma}})$ corresponds to the stationary state of the Riemann problem and can be used to compute numerical fluxes.
Notice that in this procedure, the intersection of integral curves is found by means of the tangent lines approximation at $\widebar{\tens{\sigma}}$ so that this solver does not fully account for the exact solution.

\subsection{Plane stress}
\label{sec:num_plane_stress}
We now move on to a more general plane stress case for which the stress $\sigma_{22} $ is not zero.
Although the equations of section \ref{sec:stress_paths} have been derived for two directions of propagation, attention is paid here to $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_1$ only.
%Indeed, it has been seen that similar properties of the loading paths inside the simple waves hold for both directions.

One path through a fast simple wave is first looked at by assuming an initially free-stress state, brought to the yield surface at the point $ \sigma_{11}=\sigma_{22}=0 $.
The ODEs of table \ref{tab:simpleWavesEquations} are thus integrated implicitly with $\sigma_{12}$ as driving parameter until the shear component $\sigma_{12}$ vanishes.
Two situations are considered for which the stress $\sigma_{11}$ increases or decreases.
The resulting loading paths are depicted in figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_stress}\subref{subfig:CP_fast_stress} in $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ and $(\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12})$ planes, while the projection in the deviatoric plane can be seen in figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_stress}\subref{subfig:CP_fast_dev}.
In addition, figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_stress}\subref{subfig:CP_fast_stress} shows the evolution of the characteristic speed associated to the fast wave along the path by means of a color gradient.
Thus, it can be seen that for the loadings under consideration, the waves celerities are decreasing functions of the stress so that the simple wave solutions are valid.
Next, it appears that the paths have axial symmetry, although the property has not been shown yet.
At last, analagously to the thin-walled cylinder solution, the stress components follow the initial yield surface, which is obvious in the deviatoric plane (figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_stress}\subref{subfig:CP_fast_dev}).
Furthermore, according to the property \eqref{eq:CP_roots} the stress path must be horizontal in the $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ and $(\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12})$ planes, once the intersection of with the $\sigma_{11}$-axis is reached.
As depicted in figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_stress}\subref{subfig:CP_fast_dev}, this point correspond to a direction of pure shear in the deviatoric plane.
%As a result, the plastic flow becomes significant once a direction of pure shear is reached.
Nevertheless, the numerical integration of ODEs once the shear stress $\sigma_{12}$ vanishes is not possible owing to an indeterminacy of the loading function $\psi_1^f$ that has not been identified so far.
%condition \eqref{eq:CP_roots} yields $\psi^f_1 \rightarrow \infty$ and associated numerical issues so that the loading path cannot be integrated further.
%The integration performed here nevertheless stops once $\sigma_{12}=0$ due to a singularity that has not been identified and leads to an undefined loading function $\psi_1^f$.

  \label{fig:fast_path_plane_stress}
\end{figure}

% Note that while the path is restricted to the initial yield surface, there exists a relation bewteen the principle stresses $\sigma_1 $ and $\sigma_2 $.
% Indeed, since the the out-of-plane stress $\sigma_{33}=0 $ is itself an eigenvalue of Cauchy stress tensor, the intersection of the initial yield surface with the plane $\sigma_3=0$ in the principle stress space is an ellipse as shown in figure \ref{fig:ellipse}.
% Therefore, the following relation holds:
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:ellipse_equation}
%   \(\frac{\sigma_1}{a}\)^2 + \(\frac{\sigma_2}{b}\)^2 = 1
% \end{equation}
% where $a$ and $b$ the semi-major and semi-minor axis of the ellipse.
% Find $a$ and $b $!.

%% integration jusqu'à \tau=2\sigma^y pour \sigma_{22}=\{\pm 57735026.919,0\}
We now focus on the stress evolution inside slow waves.
The same procedure is followed for several starting points on the initial yield surface.
In addition, various initial values are considered for $\sigma_{22}$ since, even for a solid in a free stress state at $t=0$, a fast wave may lead to $\sigma_{22}\neq 0$.
\begin{figure}[h!]

  \subcaptionbox{Projections of loading paths in ($\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12}$) and ($\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12}$) planes \label{subfig:CP_slow_stress1}}{\input{chapter5/pgfFigures/CPslowWaves1.tex}}

  \label{fig:slow_path_plane_stress1}
\end{figure}
The loading paths thus obtained for the (arbitrary) initial values $\sigma_{22}=-5.8\times 10^7 \: Pa$, $\sigma_{22}=0$ and $\sigma_{22}=5.8\times 10^7 \: Pa$, are respectively depicted in figures \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress1}, \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress2} and \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress3}.
The projections in the stress space and the deviatoric plane are shown.
The evolution of the characteristic speed associated to the slow wave can also be seen by means of a color gradient.
Once again, the simple wave solution appears to be valid with the considered loading conditions.
Furthermore, one can see that the stress paths are now more complex in those case since, for instance, no symmetry appears in the $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ plane.
%For instance, for a negative initial value of the stress $\sigma_{22}$ (figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress1}), the projection in the $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ plane does not allow to identify some symmetry.
Moreover, the behavior is even more complex in the $(\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12})$ plane in which the variations first mainly concern $\sigma_{22}$ and next, the slopes of curves roughly change so that the paths are almost vertical.
This sharp change in slopes is also notable in the deviatoric plane in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress1}\subref{subfig:CP_slow_dev1}.
%However, this figure does not help in finding some interpretations. 

On the other hand, similar observations can be made for the other initial values of $\sigma_{22}$ as can be seen in figures \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress2} and \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress3}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

  \label{fig:slow_path_plane_stress2}
\end{figure}
%The last set of results obtained with the initial data $\sigma_{22}<0$, which can be see in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress3}, shows a similar behavior to that of figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress1}.
However, the paths depicted in the ($\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12}$) plane in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress3}\subref{subfig:CP_slow_stress3} follow a direction opposite to those corresponding to the initial condition $\sigma_{22}=-5.8\times 10^7 \: Pa$.
%case in the $(\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12})$ plane, since $\sigma_{22}$ decreases rather than increases before the slopes of paths break (see figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress3}\subref{subfig:CP_slow_stress3}).
The previous remark is also valid in the deviatoric plane in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_stress3}\subref{subfig:CP_slow_dev3}.
Indeed, the integral curves first describe clock-wise curved lines until the break in slopes occurs, after which a behavior closed to straight lines is seen.

  \label{fig:slow_path_plane_stress3}
\end{figure}
It is worth noticing that the driving parameter used for slow waves has not been chosen arbitrarily.
As a matter of fact, the numerical integration does not go well when driven with $\sigma_{11}$.
Furthermore, numerical issues occur if the starting point is such that $\sigma_{12}=0$, thus indicating that slow waves mainly live outside of that plane.

More generally, the loading paths resulting from the integration of ODEs governing the behavior inside simple waves in plane stress can be summarized as follows.
Whereas the integral curves inside a fast wave first exhibits a phase in which the stress is restricted to the initial yield surface, the passage of a slow wave make the stress leave the elastic convex quasi-instantaneously.
It is moreover noteworthy that the shear stress component $\sigma_{12}$ undergoes the biggest variation through a slow wave, in spite of the visible combined-stress nature of the corresponding paths.
In addition, rough change in the slopes of the integral curves associated to slow waves occur.
However, such phenomena might also be observed for fast waves once the shear waves vanishes but have not been highlighted in figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_stress} due to numerical issues in integrating a function tending to infinity.
%Indeed, the theory (equation \eqref{eq:CP_roots}) predicts that this situation would lead to loading paths (locally) perpendicular to the yield surface rather than parallel.
Furthermore, after the slopes of slow waves integral cruves broke, the paths are straight the deviatoric plane.

\newpage
\subsection{Plane strain}
\label{sec:num_plane_strain}
Assuming that a solid initially at rest undergoes external loads leading to a plane strain case, the previous approach is now repeated.
However, the derivation of the hyperbolic system in a two-dimensional setting lies on the writing of the out-of-plane stress component as a function of plastic strain.
Hence, the integral curves associated to simple waves are integrated implicitly, along with the plastic flow.

Since a fast wave propagates faster than a slow one, a material particle is first acted upon by the effects of the former. 
Thus, figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_strains} shows the evolution of stresses resulting from numerical integration using $\sigma_{11}$ as driving parameter, for several starting points on the initial yield surface.
The evolution of the celerity of fast waves along the integral curve confirms the validity of the simple wave solution.
Furthermore, the starting points are chosen in such a way that a symmetry of the loading path with respect to $\sigma_{11}=0$ and $\sigma_{22}=0$ planes is notable.
Although the stress paths depicted in figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_strains}\subref{subfig:fastDP_stress} are rather different to these resulting from a fast wave in plane strain, the behaviors in the deviatoric plane are similar as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_strains}\subref{subfig:fastDP_dev}. 
Indeed, the fact that the computed loading paths through a fast wave is parallel to the initial yield surface is obvious when looking at the deviatoric plane.
More specifically, the von-Mises circle is traced by the integral curve even when the shear component $\sigma_{12}$ is zero (see paths $1$ and $6$ in figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_strains}).
Notice that the integration of loading path in the plane $\sigma_{12}=0$ is here possible contrary to plane stresses.
The integral curves of figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_strains} however exhibit a cusp which is not explained (see the two external arrows pointing toward axes of pure tensile/compression).
%Nevertheless, the results of figure \ref{fig:fast_path_plane_strains} must be taken carefully since the loading paths exhibits a cusp that is not explained so far (see the two external arrows pointing toward axes of pure tensile/compression).

\end{figure}

%% For slow waves, integrated by driving with a decreasing \tau yields an increasing celerity (it goes for fast waves driven with tau in plane stress)
On the other hand, some loading paths resulting from the integration of slow waves ODEs are depicted in figures \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains1}, \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains2} and \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains3}.
Analogously to plane stress cases, three initial values $\sigma_{22}=-1.3 \times 10^{8} \: Pa$, $\sigma_{22}=0$ and $\sigma_{22}=1.3 \times 10^8 \: Pa$ are considered since a fast wave may modify the niitial free-stress state.
The integration of loading paths through slow waves in plane strain is performed by using $\sigma_{12}$ as driving parameter.
However, numerical difficulties arise owing to the characteristic speed associated to slow waves which starts increasing rather than decreasing at some point along the path.
In order to circumvent this issue, the last stress state leading to a decreasing celerity is used as an initial condition for a second integration driven by means of $\sigma_{11}$.
The final value is set so that the variation of $\sigma_{11}$ (\textit{i.e increasing or decreasing}) undergone up to that singularity is continued.
This strategy enables to carry on the integration further.
Nevertheless, the same problem of increasing characteristic speed again occurs and the computation must be aborted.

The integral curves depicted in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains1} results from the negative initial value $\sigma_{22}=-1.3 \times 10^{8} \: Pa$ for several starting points on the initial yield surface.
While the stress $\sigma_{11}$ varies little, as shown by the projection of the path in the ($\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12}$) plane, it is not the case for $\sigma_{22}$ (see figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains1}\subref{subfig:slowDP_stress1}).
Indeed, the projections of the integral curves in ($\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12}$) plane exhibit complex paths.
In addition, it can be seen in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains1}\subref{subfig:slowDP_dev1} that, as for fast waves in plane strain, the integral curves are first restricted to the initial yield surface.
%A negative initial value of the transverse stress $\sigma_{22}=-1.3 \times 10^{8} \: Pa$ has been considered for obtaining the curves depicted in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains}.
%% Symmetry of the integral curve
% The projections of integral curves in the ($\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12}$) plane in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains}\subref{subfig:slowDP_stress1} show, roughly speaking, linear by part curves.
% Conversely, the loading paths exhibit more complex shapes in the ($\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12}$) plane.
% Analogously to the plane stress case, the slope of integral curves break at some point and then seems to be vertical in that plane.
% On the other hand, it appears in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains}\subref{subfig:slowDP_dev1} that as for fast waves, the stress state remains on the initial yield surface until the direction of pure shear is reached.
% The direction next changes so that the loading paths are radial regardless of the initial conditions considered.

% can be used if the breaks in slopes arising in both ($\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12}$) and deviatoric planes are linked.
% Indeed, Lode angle $\Theta$ measures the angle to the middle eigenvalue $s_2$ in the deviatoric plane so that it should reach a constant value of $30^o$ for the stress paths depicted in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains}.

A second phase then occurs once the direction of pure shear in the deviatoric plane is reached, during which the loading path is radial.
For the stress paths $1$ and $4$ in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains1}\subref{subfig:slowDP_dev1}, the integration goes well in the radial direction and then stops owing to the singularities mentioned above.

The same behavior is observed in figures \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains2} and \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains3} which respectively show the loading paths resulting form the zero and the positive initial values of $\sigma_{22}$.
Nevertheless, the integral curves of figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains2} reveals that numerical issues occur faster than in the previous case.
Indeed, the characteristic speeds quickly start increasing so that the stress paths depicted are short.
Furthermore, the projection in ($\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12}$) plane of the integral curves $2$ and $3$ show that the slow wave mainly influence $\sigma_{22}$.
The projections in deviatoric plane in figure \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains2} however show that the stress paths first follow the initial yield surface until the direction of pure shear is reached, and next follow the radial direction.
In addition, considering figures \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains1}, \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains2} and \ref{fig:slow_path_plane_strains3}, it can be seen that the loading paths in $(\sigma_{22},\sigma_{12})$ plane lead to an increasing $\sigma_{22}$ if the initial condition is such that $\sigma_{11}$ is greater than that corresponding to the maximum shear on the initial yield surface in projection in the $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ plane.
Conversely, an initial condition $\sigma_{11}$ lower than that associated to the maximum shear stress on the initial yield surface in the plane $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ results in a decreasing $\sigma_{22}$ along the integral curves.
Note that the same goes for $\sigma_{11}$.
Thus, it seems that the property $\sign(d\sigma_{22})=\sign(d\sigma_{11})$ holds along the loading path followed inside a slow simple wave in plane strain, though this has not been shown mathematically.

Generally speaking, it appears that for the ranges of stress considered here, the hardening of the material is mainly due to slow simple waves for plane strain cases.
Indeed, the latter may lead to radial loading paths that greatly increase the radius of the von-Mises cylinder in principal stress space, whereas the integral curves corresponding to fast waves are restricted to the initial yield surface. Notice, however, that the above results have been obtained by using a rather low hardening modulus.

If on the other hand, the hardening parameter is raised to $C=1\times10^{10} \: Pa$, the loading path slightly differ.
To illustrate this, the same plane strain problems as before are considered by using the same driving parameters and initial conditions for both fast and slow waves.
The resulting integral curves are here depicted in deviatoric plane only in order to highlight particular behaviors.

First, the fast waves integral curves are shown in figure \ref{fig:fast_H}.
As before, the integral curves follow the initial yield surface but then branch off to reach a direction of pure tensile/compression loading.

  \caption{Fast simple wave solutions of the plane strain problems $C=1\times10^{10} \: Pa$.}
  \label{fig:fast_H}
\end{figure}
Moreover, the visible cusps in the loading paths $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$, which already arise in the solutions based on a lower hardening modulus, indicates that the direction of pure tensile/compression is "aimed" inside a fast simple wave under plane strain. 

The increase in hardening parameter allows to eliminate the integration issues that occur for a lower one.
As a result, the stress paths followed inside slow simple waves depicted in figure \ref{fig:slow_H} lead to stress state lying furhter outside of the initial elastic convex.

  \caption{Slow simple wave solutions of the previous problems with $C=1\times10^{10} \: Pa$.}
  \label{fig:slow_H}
\end{figure}
Moreover, for every initial values of $\sigma_{22}$ considered in figures \ref{fig:slow_H}\subref{subfig:slow_H1}, \ref{fig:slow_H}\subref{subfig:slow_H2} and \ref{fig:slow_H}\subref{subfig:slow_H3}, the slopes of integral curves no longer break but smoothly reach the direction of pure shear in the deviatoric plane.

\begin{remark}
  The use of a higher hardening parameter for plane stress problem also leads to smoother paths in the deviatoric plane for slow waves.
  On the other hand, the integral curves associated to fast waves under plane stress (slightly) move away from the yield surface up to a direction of pure shear.
  Nevertheless, at that point numerical difficulties occur due to an indeterminacy of the loading functions.

%%%% REMARQUES A LA VOLEE
% It is shown in \cite{Ting73} that the plastic celerities only depends on $\tens{\sigma}/\norm{\tens{\sigma}}$ so that they are constant along rays of the stress space $(\sigma_{11}, \sigma_{22}, \sigma_{12})$. Thus, look at the loading path along integral curves and see the evolution of celerities.
