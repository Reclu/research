\subsection{Properties of the loading paths}
The stress paths followed within slow and fast simple waves are governed by the mathematical properties of the loading functions \eqref{eq:loading_func}.
Before specializing the discussion to plane stress and plane strain cases, some general properties holding regardless of the loading conditions are highlighted.
%The analysis is here carried out for the special case $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_1$, similar results being obtained for the other situation $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_2$.

First, the functions satisfy the orthogonality properties: $\psi^s_1\psi^f_1=-1$ and $\psi^s_2\psi^f_2=-1$.
Indeed, considering the left eigenvectors of the acoustic tensor given in equation \eqref{eq:ch5_eigenvectAcc}, the product $\psi^s_1\psi^f_1$ reads:
\begin{equation*}
  \psi^s_1\psi^f_1 = \frac{l^1_2}{l^1_1}\: \frac{l_2^2}{l^2_1}  
\end{equation*}
Since the eigenvectors of symmetric second-order tensors all satisfy $\vect{l}^1 \cdot \vect{l}^2=0$, it comes out that the above product is equal to $-1$.
Whereas this orthogonality has already been noticed for particular plane strain and plane stress cases \cite{Clifton,Ting68}, \textbf{the generic formulation proposed here allows to show that it is valid for all problems in two space dimensions}. 
% but now obviously appears as true for all problems in two space dimensions.
%However, the eigenvectors of symmetric second-order tensors all satisfy this property in such a way that it is valid for all problems in two space dimensions.
As a result, the study can be restricted to one function in each direction, say $\psi_1^s$ and $\psi_2^s$.

% Indeed, considering the left eigenvectors of the acoustic tensor given in equation \eqref{eq:ch5_eigenvectAcc}, the product $\psi^s_1\psi^f_1$ reads:
% \begin{equation*}
%   \psi^s_1\psi^f_1 = \frac{l^1_2}{l^1_1}\: \frac{l_2^2}{l^2_1} = \frac{(A_{11}-\omega_2)A_{12}}{(A_{22}-\omega_1)A_{12}}
% \end{equation*}
% Introduction of the expressions of eigenvalues $\omega_i$ from equations \eqref{eq:ch5_eigenAcc1} and \eqref{eq:ch5_eigenAcc1} further leads to:
% \begin{equation*}
%   \psi^s_1\psi^f_1 = \frac{A_{11} -A_{22} +\sqrt{(A_{11} -A_{22} )^2 + 4A_{12}^2 }}{A_{22} -A_{11} -\sqrt{(A_{11} -A_{22} )^2 + 4A_{12}^2 }}=-1
% \end{equation*}
% or equivalently, $\vect{l}^1 \cdot \vect{l}^2=0$.
% %as expected by the symmetry of $\tens{A}$.
% This orthogonality has already been noticed for particular plane strain and plane stress cases \cite{Clifton,Ting68}. % but now obviously appears as true for all problems in two space dimensions.
% However, the eigenvectors of symmetric second-order tensors all satisfy this property in such a way that it is valid for all problems in two space dimensions.
% As a result, the study can be restricted to one function in each direction, say $\psi_1^s$ and $\psi_2^s$.

Second, if the function $\psi_1^s$ vanishes at some point of the stress space, the projection in the $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ plane of the loading path followed inside a slow wave is vertical according to the ODE \eqref{eq:sigSlow_n=e1} (\textit{i.e} $d\sigma_{11}=0$).
Conversely, if $\psi_1^s\rightarrow \infty$, the loading path is horizontal in the $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ plane (\textit{i.e} $d\sigma_{12}=0$).
%Looking for vanishing $\psi^f_1$ or $1/\psi^f_1$ amounts to finding roots of the components of $\vect{l}^2$:
These situations respectively correspond to:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:first_root}
    \psi_1^s = 0   & \Leftrightarrow A_{12} =0  \\
    \label{eq:second_root}
    \psi_1^s \rightarrow \infty & \Leftrightarrow A_{22} -\omega_1 =0
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
In particular, if $A_{12}=0$ equation \eqref{eq:second_root} reads:
\begin{equation}
  A_{22} -\omega_1 = \frac{1}{2}\(A_{22} -A_{11} -\sqrt{(A_{11} -A_{22} )^2 + 4A_{12}^2 }\) = -\left\langle A _{11}-A _{22}  \right\rangle
\end{equation}
where $\left\langle \bullet \right\rangle$ denotes the positive part operator.
Hence, if $A_{12} =0$ and $A_{11} \neq A_{22} $, one has $\psi^s_1 =0$ and hence $\psi^f_1 \rightarrow -\infty $.
If moreover $A_{11}  = A_{22} $, both components of the eigenvectors vanish and the functions $\psi^s_1$ and $\psi^f_1$ are undetermined.
At last, it follows from equation \eqref{eq:diff_celerities} that the simultaneous satisfaction of conditions \eqref{eq:first_root} and \eqref{eq:second_root} leads to characteristic speeds of simple waves that are identical. Hence, the situation $c_f=c_s$ corresponds to a loss of hyperbolicity of the system.
% Hence, if $A_{12} =0$ and $A_{11} \neq A_{22} $, one has $\psi^s_1 =0$ and $\psi^f_1 \rightarrow \infty $, so that the stress path in the ($\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12}$) plane are vertical (\textit{resp. horizontal}) through a slow (\textit{resp. fast}) wave. 

Analogously, the function $\psi_2^s$ is such that:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:first_root_psi2cp}
    \psi_2^s \rightarrow \infty  & \Leftrightarrow A_{12} =0  \\
    \label{eq:second_root_psi2cp}
    \psi_2^s =0 & \Leftrightarrow A_{22} -\omega_1 =0
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Therefore, if both conditions \eqref{eq:first_root_psi2cp} and \eqref{eq:second_root_psi2cp} are satisfied on $A_{12}$ and $A_{22} -\omega_1$, the system is no longer hyperbolic with characteristic speeds of fast and slow waves that are identical.

According to the ODEs of table \ref{tab:simpleWavesEquations}, the particular values of the loading functions $\psi_i^{s,f}$ through the simple waves propagating in direction $\vect{e}_i$ for $i=\{1,2\}$, provide information about the loading paths in stress space.
First, $\psi^{s,f}_i =0$ leads to $d\sigma_{ii}=0$ (no sum on $i$) so that the longitudinal stress is constant within the simple wave.
Conversely, with loading functions tending to infinity, the stress $\sigma_{12}$ does not vary.
Notice that the coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ of the left eigenvector of the Jacobian matrix associated to the zero eigenvalue \eqref{eq:ch5_null_left_eigen} also have to be regarded.
Nevertheless, those terms resulting from products of the components of the elastoplastic tangent modulus have complex expressions and are assumed to have non-zero values in the remainder of the manuscript.

The above discussions are now specified to plane strain and plane stress, for which loading conditions leading to $A_{12} =0$ and $A _{11}-A _{22}=0$ are identified.



\subsection{The plane strain case}
The case of plane strain is first considered by using the elastoplastic tangent modulus so that the components of the acoustic tensor for $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_1$ read:
%The elastoplastic tangent modulus under consideration is now that given in equation \eqref{eq:elastoplastic_tangent}, so that the components of the acoustic tensor for $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_1$ read: 
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:DP_A11}
    & A_{11}^{ep}= C_{1111}^{ep} = \lambda + 2\mu -\beta s_{11}^2 \\
    \label{eq:DP_A22}
    & A_{22}^{ep}= C_{2121}^{ep}= \mu -\beta s_{12}^2 \\
    \label{eq:DP_A12}
    & A_{12}^{ep}= C_{1121}^{ep}=-\beta s_{11}s_{12}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
The associated eigenvalues are then:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:eigen_acc_DP}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:eigen_acc_DP1}
    & \rho c_s^2 = \frac{1}{2}\( \lambda +3\mu -\beta (s_{11}^2+ s_{12}^2) - \sqrt{(\lambda + \mu -\beta (s_{11}^2-s_{12}^2) )^2 +4(\beta s_{11}s_{12})^2} \) \\
    \label{eq:eigen_acc_DP2}
    & \rho c_f^2 = \frac{1}{2}\( \lambda +3\mu -\beta (s_{11}^2+ s_{12}^2) + \sqrt{(\lambda + \mu -\beta (s_{11}^2-s_{12}^2) )^2 +4(\beta s_{11}s_{12})^2}  \)
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Subtracting equations \eqref{eq:DP_A11} and \eqref{eq:DP_A22}, one gets: $A_{11}^{ep}-A_{22}^{ep}= \lambda + \mu -\beta \(s_{11}^2-s_{12}^2\)$.
Hence, the equation $A_{11}^{ep}-A_{22}^{ep}=0$ admits a set of solutions in the deviatoric stress space.
On the other hand, we see from equation \eqref{eq:DP_A12} that $A_{12}^{ep}$ vanishes for $s_{12}=0$ or $s_{11}=0$.
% Recall that $A^{ep}_{12}=0$ leads to vertical and horizontal loading paths across slow and fast waves respectively. 
Each solution is studied in more details below.

%% Sign of one of the functions psi... but not used afterwards
% We first study the sign of the functions $\psi^f$ by noticing that $\mu=\rho c_2^2$ so that $A_{22}^{ep}$ may be rewritten to yield:
% \begin{equation*}
%   \psi^f = -\frac{A_{12}^{ep}}{A_{22}-\rho c_f^2}= -\frac{\beta s_{11}s_{12}}{\rho c_f^2-\rho c_2^2 +\beta s_{12}^2 }
% \end{equation*}
% Since the denominator is positive for $c_f \geq c_2$, it comes out that $\sign (\psi^f) = - \sign(s_{12}) \sign(s_{11})$. Moreover, two roots of the loading function $\psi^f$ can be identified.

\paragraph*{Condition $s_{12}=0$:} 
According to equations \eqref{eq:eigen_acc_DP1} and \eqref{eq:eigen_acc_DP2}, the eigenvalues of the acoustic tensor become:
\begin{align*}
  & \rho c_s^2 = \frac{1}{2}\( \lambda +3\mu -\beta s_{11}^2 - \abs{\lambda + \mu -\beta s_{11}^2 } \) \\
  & \rho c_f^2 = \frac{1}{2}\( \lambda +3\mu -\beta s_{11}^2 + \abs{\lambda + \mu -\beta s_{11}^2 } \)
\end{align*}
Two cases are to be considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] if $\beta s_{11}^2 < \lambda + \mu$, the expression further reduces to:
  \begin{align*}
    & \rho c_s^2 = \mu \\
    & \rho c_f^2 = \lambda +2\mu -\beta s_{11}^2 
  \end{align*}
  The characteristic speed of slow waves therefore identifies with this of elastic shear waves for plane strain $c_s=c_2=\sqrt{\mu/\rho}$. 
\item[(ii)] if $ \lambda + \mu - \beta s_{11}^2 <0$, the characteristic speeds read: 
  \begin{align*}
    & \rho c_s^2 = \lambda +2\mu -\beta s_{11}^2  \\
    & \rho c_f^2 =  \mu 
  \end{align*}
  As a result, in that case it is the celerity of fast waves which reduces to that of elastic shear waves.
  Note, however, that in that case the characteristic speed of slow waves remains real if and only if $\lambda +2\mu >\beta s_{11}^2$.
  One then gets the following bounds: $\lambda +2\mu > \beta s_{11}^2 > \lambda +\mu$
\end{itemize}
At last, the equality $\beta s_{11}^2 = \lambda + \mu$ leads to $A_{11}^{ep}-A_{22}^{ep}=0$ and hence, to undetermined loading functions. 
%% Set of admissible values for s11 (depends on s itself)
% It then appears that the values of $s_{11}$ ensuring hyperbolicity of the system are:
% \begin{equation}
%   s_{11} \in ]-\infty,-\sqrt{\frac{\lambda + \mu}{\beta}}[\: \cup\: ]-\sqrt{\frac{\lambda + \mu}{\beta}},\sqrt{\frac{\lambda + \mu}{\beta}}[\: \cup \:]\sqrt{\frac{\lambda + \mu}{\beta}} ,\infty[
% \end{equation}

%% Discussion about the loading path direction
% Recall that $\psi^f_1$ tending to infinity implies that the loading path are horizontal in $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ plane and hence, the fast wave has no influence on the shear stress if, and only if, $\sigma_{12}=0$ downstream.
% Conversely, the stress paths through slow simple waves are vertical.
% Moreover, with regard the last row of table \ref{tab:simpleWavesEquations}, $\sigma_{22}$ is also unchanged in that case.
% As a consequence, if the initial state is shear-free the solution no longer contain combined waves, but longitudinal stress and shear stress simple waves.

\paragraph*{Condition $s_{11}=0$:}
Considering the relation \eqref{eq:plane_strain_stress33} between stress components for plane strain, one writes:
\begin{equation*}
  s_{11}= \frac{2}{3}\sigma_{11}-\frac{1}{3}(\sigma_{22}+\nu(\sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22})-E\eps^p_{33})
\end{equation*}
so that $s_{11}=0$ is equivalent to:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:plane_strain_s11=0}
  \sigma_{11}=\frac{1+\nu}{2-\nu}\sigma_{22}-E\eps^p_{33}
\end{equation}
In contrast to what has been seen previously, the functions $\psi$ cannot be undetermined in the case $s_{11}=0$ since the equation $A_{11}^{ep}-A_{22}^{ep}=\lambda + \mu + \beta s_{12}^2=0$ does not admit real solutions.
However, the stress state \eqref{eq:plane_strain_s11=0} yields the following characteristic speeds:
\begin{align*}
  & \rho c_s^2 = \mu -\beta s_{12}^2 \\
  & \rho c_f^2 = \lambda +2\mu 
\end{align*}
so that the celerity of fast waves identifies with that of elastic pressure waves under plane strains $c_f=\sqrt{(\lambda + 2\mu)/\rho}=c_1$.

The same analysis can be carried out in the direction $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_2$ by considering the following acoustic tensor components:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:DP_A11_n2}
    & A_{11}^{ep}= C_{1212}^{ep} = \mu -\beta s_{12}^2 \\
    \label{eq:DP_A22_n2}
    & A_{22}^{ep}= C_{2222}^{ep}= \lambda + 2\mu -\beta s_{22}^2 \\
    \label{eq:DP_A12_n2}
    & A_{12}^{ep}= C_{1222}^{ep}=-\beta s_{22}s_{12}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
The characteristic speeds are then:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:eigen_acc_DP_n2}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:eigen_acc_DP1_n2}
    & \rho c_s^2 = \frac{1}{2}\( \lambda +3\mu -\beta (s_{22}^2+ s_{12}^2) - \sqrt{(\lambda +\mu -\beta (s_{22}^2-s_{12}^2) )^2 +4(\beta s_{22}s_{12})^2} \) \\
    \label{eq:eigen_acc_DP2_n2}
    & \rho c_f^2 = \frac{1}{2}\( \lambda +3\mu -\beta (s_{22}^2+ s_{12}^2) + \sqrt{(\lambda + \mu -\beta (s_{22}^2-s_{12}^2) )^2 +4(\beta s_{22}s_{12})^2}  \)
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
With the above expressions, the same remarks than for $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_1$ can obviously be made by replacing $s_{11}$ with $s_{22}$.

Among the above results, the most significant arises from the condition $s_{12}=0$.
Indeed, it has been seen that $A_{12}^{ep}=0$ leads to $\psi_1^s=0$ and $\psi^s_2\rightarrow \infty$ in such a way that the corresponding loading paths in the $(\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12})$ plane are respectively vertical and horizontal.
In virtue of the orthogonality property of the loading functions, the stress path followed in a fast wave propagating in the direction $\vect{e}_1$ is horizontal in the same plane.
Hence, if the path through a fast wave intersects the plane $\sigma_{12}=0$, the shear stress component remains constant afterwards.
The same result holds for the slow wave propagating in the direction $\vect{e}_2$.
The above conclusion are summarized in table \ref{tab:stress_paths_properties}.
\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \input{chapter5/tabular/stress_paths}
  \caption{Loading paths in projection into ($\sigma_{11},\sigma_{12}$) plane followed across slow and fast simple waves, under the condition $\sigma_{12}=0$ assuming that $A_{11}^{ep}-A_{22}^{ep}\neq 0$.}
  \label{tab:stress_paths_properties}
\end{table}
\subsection{The plane stress case}
The elastoplastic tangent modulus under consideration is now that given in equation \eqref{eq:CP_constitutive}.
Let's first consider $\psi_1^s$ related to the vector $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_1$.
Thus:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:CP_Acoustic}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:CP_A11}
    & \widetilde{A}_{11}^{ep}= C^{ep}_{1111} - \frac{(C^{ep}_{1133})^2}{C^{ep}_{3333}} = \lambda + 2\mu -\beta s_{11}^2 -\frac{\(\lambda -\beta s_{11}s_{33}\)^2}{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2} \\
    \label{eq:CP_A22}
    & \widetilde{A}_{22}^{ep}= C^{ep}_{2121} - \frac{(C^{ep}_{2133})^2}{C^{ep}_{3333}}= \mu - \beta s_{12}^2 -\frac{\(\beta s_{12}s_{33}\)^2}{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2} \\
    \label{eq:CP_A12}
    & \widetilde{A}_{12}^{ep} = C^{ep}_{1121} - \frac{C^{ep}_{1133}C^{ep}_{1233}}{C^{ep}_{3333}} =\beta s_{12} \frac{\lambda s_{33} - (\lambda + 2\mu)s_{11} }{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2} 
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
In order to ensure the hyperbolicity of the system, the component of the acoustic tensor also have to be defined, that is $C^{ep}_{3333}> 0$. This condition leads to:
\begin{equation*}
  \lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2 > 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad s_{33}^2 < \frac{\lambda + 2\mu}{\beta}
\end{equation*}
Second, from equation \eqref{eq:CP_A12}, $\widetilde{A}_{12}^{ep}$ admits two roots in terms of the components of the deviatoric stress tensor, namely: 
\begin{equation}
  s_{12}=0 \quad ; \quad s_{11}= \frac{\lambda}{\lambda+2\mu}s_{33}
\end{equation}
In terms of the components of Cauchy stress tensor, those conditions read:
% \begin{align}
%   & \frac{2}{3}\sigma_{11}-\frac{1}{3}\sigma_{22} = -\frac{\lambda}{3\lambda+6\mu}(\sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22}) \\
%   & 2\sigma_{11}-\sigma_{22} = -\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+2\mu}(\sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22}) \\
%   & \sigma_{11}(2 +\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+2\mu})=\sigma_{22}(1-\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+2\mu})\\
%   & \sigma_{11}\frac{3\lambda+4\mu}{\lambda+2\mu}=\sigma_{22}\frac{2\mu}{\lambda+2\mu}\\
%   & \sigma_{11}=\sigma_{22}\frac{2\mu}{3\lambda+4\mu}
% \end{align}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:CP_roots}
  \sigma_{12}=0 \quad ; \quad \sigma_{11}=\frac{2\mu}{3\lambda+4\mu}\sigma_{22}
  % \sigma_{12}=0 \quad ; \quad \sigma_{11}=\frac{1-2\nu}{2-\nu} \sigma_{22}
\end{equation}
% Hence, the loading path through a slow simple wave is vertical, that is $\psi^s_1 = 0$, for stress values satisfying \eqref{eq:CP_roots}, providing that the $\widetilde{A}_{11}^{ep}$ and $\widetilde{A}_{22}^{ep}$ are not equal.
% Conversely, such stress states yield horizontal path through a fast wave.

%% Attempt to show that if s12=0, cs=c2 but depends on the sign of A11-A22
% \begin{align}
%   &\omega_2=\frac{1}{2}\(A_{11}+A_{22} - \abs{A_{11}-A_{22}}\)\\
%   &\omega_2=\frac{1}{2}\(A_{11}+A_{22} - A_{11}+A_{22}\) \quad ;\quad \omega_2=\frac{1}{2}\(A_{11}+A_{22} + A_{11}-A_{22}\) \\
%   &\omega_2=A_{22} \quad ;\quad \omega_2=A_{11}
% \end{align}


% \paragraph*{Case $s_{12}=0$ :}
% \begin{align}
%   & \rho c_s^2 =\frac{1}{2}\(\widetilde{A}_{11}^{ep}+\widetilde{A}_{22}^{ep} - \abs{\widetilde{A}_{11}^{ep}-\widetilde{A}_{22}^{ep}}\) \\
%   & \rho c_f^2 =\frac{1}{2}\(\widetilde{A}_{11}^{ep}+\widetilde{A}_{22}^{ep} + \abs{\widetilde{A}_{11}^{ep}-\widetilde{A}_{22}^{ep}}\)
% \end{align}

If on the other hand the vector $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_2$ is considered, the acoustic tensors components read:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{eq:CP_A11_n=e2}
    & \widetilde{A}_{11}^{ep}= C^{ep}_{1212} - \frac{(C^{ep}_{1233})^2}{C^{ep}_{3333}} = \mu -\beta s_{12}^2 -\frac{\(\lambda -\beta s_{12}s_{33}\)^2}{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2} \\
    \label{eq:CP_A22_n=e2}
    & \widetilde{A}_{22}^{ep}= C^{ep}_{2222} - \frac{(C^{ep}_{2233})^2}{C^{ep}_{3333}}= \lambda +2\mu - \beta s_{22}^2 -\frac{\(\beta s_{22}s_{33}\)^2}{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2} \\
    \label{eq:CP_A12_n=e2}
    % \widetilde{A}_{12}^{ep}    = -\beta s_{12}s_{22} - \frac{(-\beta s_{12}s_{33})(\lambda - \beta s_{22}s_{33})}{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2}
    % \widetilde{A}_{12}^{ep}    = \beta s_{12}\( s_{33}\frac{\lambda - \beta s_{22}s_{33}}{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2}-s_{22}\)
    % \widetilde{A}_{12}^{ep}    = \beta s_{12}\( \frac{\lambda s_{33}  -s_{22}(\lambda + 2\mu ) }{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2}\)
    & \widetilde{A}_{12}^{ep} = C^{ep}_{1222} - \frac{C^{ep}_{1233}C^{ep}_{2233}}{C^{ep}_{3333}} =\beta s_{12} \frac{\lambda s_{33} - (\lambda + 2\mu)s_{22} }{\lambda + 2\mu - \beta s_{33}^2}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Which are similar to these obtained for $\vect{n}=\vect{e}_1$ \eqref{eq:CP_Acoustic} with $s_{22}$ instead of $s_{11}$.
It comes out that $\widetilde{A}_{12}^{ep}$ admits to roots:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:CP_roots_n=e2}
  \sigma_{12}=0 \quad ; \quad \sigma_{22}=\frac{2\mu}{3\lambda+4\mu}\sigma_{11}
\end{equation}

The complexity introduced by the plane stress tangent modulus prevents the finding of other singular configurations for the hyperbolic system. 
In particular, it is difficult to deal with the equation $\widetilde{A}^{ep}_{11}=\widetilde{A}^{ep}_{22}$ due to the expressions given in equations \eqref{eq:CP_A11} and \eqref{eq:CP_A22}.
Nevertheless, since the stress state $s_{12}=0$ also constitutes a singular point for plane stresses, the same remarks than these made for plane strains on the loading paths hold.
Namely, $\sigma_{12}$ becomes constant if it falls to zero along the loading path followed inside a fast (\textit{resp. slow}) wave propagating in direction $\vect{e}_1$ (\textit{resp. $\vect{e}_2$}) as summarized in table \ref{tab:stress_paths_properties}.
%Namely, if $\sigma_{12}$ falls to zero along the loading path followed inside a fast (\textit{resp. slow}) wave propagating in direction $\vect{e}_1$ (\textit{resp. $\vect{e}_2$}), is restricted to that value.
%As we shall see below, more singular behaviors can be identified for plane strain.
