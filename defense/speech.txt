INTRODUCTION

--- General context ---
Concerned with solid dynamics problems such as Impact or crash-proof design:
    in the first case, one wants to ensure that a structure undegoing dynamic loadings remains usable while in the latter, it is expected to dissipate as much energy as possible so that the passengers are safe
    
On the other hand, high-speed forming techniques are important industrial applications in the field of solid dynamics.
Here is depicted a video of electromagnetic forming process which is developed at ecole centrale
The optimization of the process requires to properly assess the residual states in terms of strains and stresses in order to get the desired shape for metallic bodies.

Such physical phenomena can be mathematically modeled by means of partial differential equations which, for solids, are written as hyperbolic equations.
However, the exact solution of these equations is made difficult and even not possible by complex geometries, the waves involved and enventual large deformations.
As a result, the numerical simulation is a way of providing approximate solutions.

--- Numerical methods ---

## FEM
Among the big stars of existing numerical methods, the FEM uses a mesh to represent a solid domain
The weak form of the linear momentum balance equation is written in order to build an poylonomial approximation of the solution of hyperbolic problems
The weaknesses and strengths of Lagrangian formulations of FEM, when applied to solid dynamics can be roughly represented as follows:
while the method enables high-order approximation and exhibits low diffusion, as it would not be the case for the Eulerian formulation due to advection terms, it suffers from oscillations near discontinuous solutions and from mesh difficulties for large deformations. 

## FVM
On the other hand, the FVM originally developed for fluid dynamics and applied to solids, is based on conservation laws written on control volumes.
The main characteristics of this approach is that it relies on a cell-wise approximation and on numerical fluxes that allow to account for the mathemaatical structure of the solution within numerical schemes.
Unlike FEM, numerical oscillations are avoided and high-order approximation is achievable but it is less convenient.
However, Lagrangian formulations of FVM also lead to mesh difficulties when updating the geometry since the velocity can be discontinuous

## DGFEM
The discontinuous galerkin approximation allows to take advantage of finite volume technology in a finite element framework
As a result, high-order approximation can be achieved without oscillations
It is however worth noticing that the time step can be very restrictive with this approach
It then appears that some difficulties related to the mesh are encourted with all the previous methods. 

## MPM
Mesh-free approaches allow to bypassed some of them.
In particular, the material point method, which is also an extension of techniques developed for fluid dynamics to solids, uses a collection of material points to represent a domain.
The particles can move in an arbitrary grid and can thus be seen as an extension of FEM with moving Gauss points in which mesh entanglement is avoided.
Then, projections of fields between particles and the grid are required.


The original Particle-In-Cell approach, is characterized by non-oscillating solutions but a significant diffusion.
In order to circumvent this issue, an alternative projection which led to the Fluid Implicit Particle method has been proposed.
This new version of the MPM indeed reduces the numerical diffusion, but at the cost of spurious oscillations.

--- Objective n°1 ---
Given the difficulties involved by hyperbolic problems, a numerical method able to handle large deformations while providing non-oscillating solutions with low diffusion would be valuable.

Thus, the first purpose of this work is to develop such a numerical tool.
The strategy will be to merge the advantages of FEM, FVM and MPM by means of the DG approximation in order to cover a bigger area in the schematic representation of pros and cons. 
We think that using the coupling of PIC mapping and DG approximation will yields non-oscillating solutions with low dissipation.

--- Objective n°2 ---
As already mentioned, the use of interface fluxes inherited from the compulational fluid community enables to introduce some amount of exact solution within numerical schemes.

We think that accurate solutions can be computed providing that the physical response is identified and hence, mimicked by a numerical method.

However, such responses are still not known for some material models and require additional investigations so that the numerical solution can be improved.

Thus, the second purpose of the thesis is the identification of the physical response of elastic-plastic solids to dynamic loadings in two space dimensions.

--- Outline ---

The remaining of the presentation will then be split as follows:

First of all, the Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method will be derived within the finite deformation framework, analysed and illustrated on numerical simulations.

Second of all, we will focus on the solution of hyperbolic problems in two-dimensional elastic-plastic solids.

PART I

## Derivation of the method

-- Continuum equations --

-- Discrete equations --
First-order polynomials only

## Numerical analysis
-- Convergence --
We now focus on the convergence analysis of the method.
We consider a one-dimensional bar undergoing an external loading that smoothly varie with time on its left end.
The domain is discretized with regulary spaced material points in a grid so that two particles lie in each cell.
The problem is solved with a finer and finer mesh in which the number of particles per cell is kept constant.
The figures respectively show the evolution of the L2 error on stress and velocity at the end of the computation for several discretizations.
From these figures, we see that the stress accuracy for MPM and DGMPM is one regardless of the time discretization used for the DGMPM
As expected from the use of a conservation law system, it appears that the rate of convergence of velocity is similar to that of stress for the DGMPM.
It seems that this loss of accuracy compared to what is expected from finite element formulation for instance, is due to the PIC mapping used.
This can be seen in the right figure in which the evolution of the L2 error of the velocity fields provided by the MPM using Flip or Pic mapping are depicted.
We can see that the Flip mapping leads to second-order accuracy while Pic one yields only first-order.

These observations hold for other particles distributions:
      the same order of accuracy is reached for velocity and stress in DGMPM
      Furthermore, the second-order time discretization.
      At last, Flip mapping leads to second-order accuracy in the MPM while pic one leads to only first-order.

## Numerical Simulations

We now move on to the illustration of the DGMPM on one and two-dimensional simulations

-- one-dimensional problems --	   

### Elastic bar
We first consider a one-dimensional bar on which Riemann-type initial conditions are prescribed.
Namely, a positive velocity is prescribed in the left half and a negative one in the right one.
The exact solution of this problem consists in two elastic discontinuities propagating in the medium.

The results provided by DGMPM and MPM are compared for several regular particles distributions in 50 grid cells. v0=c/2000


First, since the DGMPM using 1ppc is stable for a Courant number set at one, the discontinuity can be captured by the method.
However, for other particles distributions, the CFL must be decreased and the method is less diffusive but non-oscillating.

Those results are confirmed by the energy plots.
We can see that the DGMPM using more than one particle per cell is more diffusive than the original MPM.
However, it is worth noticing that the diffusion is lower than that exhibited by the MPM based on Pic mapping, which was one of the objectives aimed by the introduction of the DG approximation in the MPM.

### Elastic-plastic plane wave
Next, we consider one-dimensional elastic-plastic solids.

It is well known that plastic flow gives rise to plastic waves in addition to elastic ones.
There exist, for one-dimensional solids, an elastic-plastic approximate Riemann solver that account for this enriched characteristic structure.
The approach consists in first solving an elastic problem and project the stationnary state on the yield criterion in order to add plastic waves if plastic flow occurs.
This kind of solver yields more accurate results and also the ability to limit both elastic and plastic waves.

Considering a problem similar to the previous one, but under a plane wave state, numerical results are compared to the exact solutions.

The MPM and DGMPM have been used with one particle per cell, with each material point overlaping FEM and FVM cells centroids.
The Finite Volume scheme uses an elastic-plastic approximate Riemann solver and both elastic and plastic waves are limited.
Conversely, the approximate Riemann solver used within the DGMPM is purely elastic and the plastic flow rules are integrated at material points by means of a radial return algorithm.

The figures depicted here show longitudinal stress and plastic strain profiles after the reflection of elastic waves on the free boundaries of the domain.
As we can see, the finite element stress oscillates on the plastic plateau while the other methods behave better.
Second, the plastic discontinuity is more accurately captured by the FVM than it is by the DGMPM, due to the use of the elastic-plastic Riemann solver and the limiting of plastic waves.
As a result, FVM plastic strain is closer to the exact solution that that provided by the other approaches.
It thus highlights the numerical improvement enabled by the knowledge of the characteristic structure.

### Hyperelastic plane wave
We now consider a one-dimensional medium made of a hyperelastic SVK material, which undergoes a compression load on its left end.
Even though the SVK model is not the most realistic one, the exact solution of this problem has been developed and published.

The solution consists in a right-going simple wave.
Once again, DGMPM solutions are compared to MPM one using one particle per cell.
It is however worth noticing that in order to avoid the grid crossing instability encourted in the MPM, the method has been formulated in a total Lagrangian fashion.
Even for non-linear problems DGMPM solutions do not oscillate but using more than one material point per cell leads to a less accurate solution due to the decrease in Courant number it requires.
Nevertheless, the solutions computed with a Courant number set to unity are pretty close to the exact one.

If a tensile load of the same amplitude is set, the exact solution consist of a right-going shock wave.
Once again, DGMPM solutions are close to the exact one though slight oscillations appear.
However, those oscillations reduce with time.
Of course, if two particles per cell are used within the DGMPM, the solution using the Forward Euler algorithm is less accurate.

-- Two-dimensional problems --


## Hyperelastic 
Let's now move on to two-dimensional problems by first considering a tensile impact on the left part of a square domain.
The medium is made of the neoHoookean material and a plane strain case is assumed.

MPM and DGMPM coupled to forward Euler solutions using one particle per cell are compared to the FEM solution provided by Abaqus.
Quadrangular bilinear elements and no artificial viscosity is used within Abaqus.
Moreover the DGMPM makes use of the transverse correction of intercell fluxes so that the Courant number can be set to unity.
It is not the case for FEM and MPM.
At last, for this comparison, the material points overlap the FEM nodes.

The velocity field is depicted on the deformed configuration.
We again see that FEM and MPM solutions oscillate whereas the DGMPM one behaves well. 
Also, the deformed configurations provided by the three methods are quite similar in spite of some error made by the DGMPM in the loaded region.
This is a point that must be improved in the method.

## Hyperelastic-plastic material
Still under plane strain, a square domain made of a hyperelastic-plastic material is considered.
In that domain, a negative initial velocity is prescribed and both bottom and left boundary are normally fixed.

The same discretization than before is considered and the comparison between FEM MPM and DGMPM is performed.
The FEM solution is now provided by a in-house code and the plastic flow is integrated by means a variational solver in every numerical methods.

The equivalent plastic strain is here depicted on the updated geometry.
The deformed squares resulting from the three methods are again quite similar and no significant overshoots appear. 
Actually this simulation is here proposed for illustration purpose rather than for quantitative comparisons.

-- Conclusion of part I --
As a partial conclusion, the DGMPM has been developed in the finite strain framework.


PART II

We will now go through the second part of the thesis.

It has been emphasized in the introduction that the correct assessement of residual states is of major importance.
It has also been seen that the numerical solution in elastic-plastic solids becomes more accurate if additional information about the characteristic structure of the problem is considered.
Nevertheless, such tools only exist for one-dimensional problems since the response of elastoplastic solids to dynamic loading is in general misknown.

Hence the second objective of the thesis: identify the response of two-dimensional elastic-plastic solids to dynamic loadings. 
The gain would be double since it would allow to better understand the physics and to improve numerical simulations.	      

First, a historical review will be made before I recall the governing equations.
Then, the characteristic analysis of the hyperbolic problems will be carried out and finally supplemented by numerical results.

-- Formulation of the problem --

## Historical review
The early works on multi-dimensional elastoplastic solids in the dynamic regime go back to the 50's and considered a combined shear and longitudinal stress state. 
In the elastic regime, the solutions consists of 4 elastic discontinuities propagating in the medium.

Rakhmatulin and Cristescu nevertheless highlighted mathematically the existence of four other nonlinear waves that can possibly arrise, two slow and two fast waves.
More recently, in the 60's, Clifton carried out the characteristic analysis of this particular problem and wrote a system of Ordinary Differential Equations that are satisfied throug heach plastic waves.
These ODEs govern stress paths as well as the evolution of the components of the velocity.
The problem is however particular in that the characteristic structure of the problem can not be known a priori.
Indeed, Clifton showed that the solution may involve one fast, one slow, or both simple waves.
In that sense, the loading paths provided by Clifton are very important since they allow, for a given stationary state, to integrate backward the loading path to the initial condition, and hence to determine the waves involved.
